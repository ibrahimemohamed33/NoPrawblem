,"Fellow MM, fanatics, should I watch The Sopranos?","I‚Äôm an absolute mad men addict. I love everything about it, have rewatched probably 6-7 times.

It's not a class assignment and everyone likes what they like."", 'that‚Äôs good to know, i‚Äôll try that approach. thanks!', 'You definitely need to watch beyond season 1 to get a good sense of the show though.  The first season is a lot closer to a traditional gangster story.  It has a lot more cliches/some weird plot holes (Tony is boss in the pilot but a capo in the second episode).  The second season is where the show really comes into its own - becoming more of an American family chronicle than just a mob show.  (And it really is so much more - the show explores everything from mental health and depression to gender relations and family dynamics to Freud, the Oedipus Complex, and the long term decline of the United States).  Also, some of the most fantastic writing/acting is towards the end of the show (especially season 6).\n\nThat said, the Sopranos is an acquired taste. I enjoyed it on my first watch through, but not as much as Mad Men or Breaking Bad/Better Call Saul (my other favorite shows).

My top 3 is Mad Men #1 followed by The Wire and the sopranos in a tie for second but an arms length behind Mad Men.

Also if you're looking for a not too long of a series The Deuce on HBO Max is only 3 seasons about the fall of the pimp game and the rise of porn in manhattan in the decade of the 70's.

He knows that it can be purely transactional and mechanical rather than needing to be emotional and intimate', 'I viewed this line as pretty healthy to be honest. Sometimes when a line like this sticks with me I like to ask ‚Äúwho is this character thinking about when they say this?‚Äù Don‚Äôs relationships with Peggy and Anna fit the bill for sure. They are both incredibly close to him and yet, he has not slept with either of them. Looking at this from a removed or detached view is certainly possible given his childhood or adult age promiscuity but there‚Äôs also a pretty vulnerable one.', 'Yes! He‚Äôs not just saying people have sex with no feelings, he‚Äôs saying that feeling close to someone can happen without sex. Even having titles like ‚Äúson‚Äù or ‚Äúfather‚Äù or ‚Äúhusband‚Äù don‚Äôt equate to closeness to Don. It‚Äôs something he‚Äôs always searching for.', 'Like the other comments said, Don‚Äôs childhood growing up in a brothel definitely influenced his feelings towards sex and he knows that it can be transactional. \n\nBut for Betty, I think her views towards sex were influenced by cultural and gender norms of the era she grew up in as well. Sex was a topic that wasn‚Äôt supposed to be discussed. Women were shamed if they slept around, the main idea being that the only person a woman should ever sleep with was her husband (someone she‚Äôs emotionally close to.) She hasn‚Äôt slept with many people in her entire life (probably as a result of both personal feelings and societal expectations) which is why she thinks of sex being intertwined with emotional intimacy.', 'Pretty wild that Betty only slept with 3 people in her entire life. Don, Cuban Missle Crisis hookup, and Henry', 'For most people, sexual intimacy is an important part of romantic relationships. Many people want to have a sexual connection with their romantic partner as an opportunity to bond and show affection and love. \n\nThis is how Betty views sex‚Äî she values it and understands it‚Äôs importance in a relationship. However, Don‚Äôs perception of sex is so warped from his childhood sexual abuse that he doesn‚Äôt value it at all anymore. Growing up in a brothel made it so Don views sex as currency or solely for physical pleasure. He feels nothing.', 'Don seems to value sex as a *service* he provides. Many times in the show we‚Äôre reminded he doesn‚Äôt just get laid a lot - he performs for the women to the point he has a reputation for his prowess. Betty even notices sometimes he seems to be doing what someone else likes in bed. Like a lot of abuse survivors, Don sees his sexual performance as a way of proving his worth.', 'I also think that for Don, because of his sexual trauma, he is most likely using sex as an escape and probably isn‚Äôt all the way present. I don‚Äôt doubt that he enjoys sex, but his dialogue here suggests that he doesn‚Äôt it see the physical connection of sex as intimacy. So I imagine sex is playing another role, seeking pleasure, but isn‚Äôt him being known. And he would prefer it that way.', ""Don's not as good at separating sex from emotions as he thinks he is.

,"Finished watching season 2 for the first time, here are my thoughts","Some of you might remember this post I made a while back about my first watch of season 1: https://www.reddit.com/r/madmen/comments/revegy/first_watch_finished_season_1_here_are_my/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

Well, as promised, I'm here now with my thoughts about season 2. I'm sorry it took so long, I don't like binge-watching. Will try to be faster next time

So, I've been watching through all the big, acclaimed TV shows in the last few years; Game of Thrones, The Sopranos, The Wire, Breaking Bad, and so on. What I've noticed is that season 2 is often the slowest season. It's the one where the show has to take the initial premise introduced in the first season, consolidate it, expand it, and give it the depth required as a foundation for the rest of the show.

And season 2 of Mad Men is no different. It took everything I liked from season 2 and gave it all the more focus. But it definitely took its time in doing so. In many ways it felt transitionary; taking stock of the previous season and preparing us for what's to come.

Where it did really well was, once again, the characters. They already showed a lot of promise in the first season, and here is where they really start to come alive and feel real.

Let's start with Don himself. When I first started watching, he felt like a man who, all things considered, was in charge of himself. He knew life, knew himself, he was in control.

The more I watch, the more that illusion begins to crumble. Is he really in charge of himself if he can give certain instructions for an ad design in one moment, and completely change his mind the next? Is he really in control if he compulsively jumps from one affair to the next, with little thought about the consequences, both external and internal?

Sure, he has mastered the art of deception, of creating, selling and maintaining a narrative on the spot. Living with a fake identity probably teaches you some of that. But any reminder of the truth can shake him and throw him off. The scene where Sally's words brings him to think of Bobbie when shaving one morning really brought this home. 

This becomes all the more evident in the last couple of episodes, when Betty throws him out of the house. The idea that the little world he has created with his family could fall apart genuinely terrifies him. Does he love Betty, does he care about being a good father, a family man? It's doubtful, but he definitely wants to maintain that self image. 

Speaking of Betty, she was probably the standout character of the season. Much like Don, she's eager to maintain the appearance of domestic bliss. But she can't do it by herself, and when she's confronted with the reality of his latest affair, she literally throws up. Sure, their marriage wasn't perfect, but she tried, for him. He couldn't try for her.

With the horses, the seperation, and even her own little affair in the finale, she's slowly forcing herself to take some agency in a life that didn't turn out like she expected. Giving up the illusions she's lived by is hard, but it's becoming the only way forward. With the impending loss of her father, and her disillusionement with Don, she's going to have to learn to live on her own accord.

As of the finale, it seems like their teased divorce might not come to be. Will Don make the effort to keep their marriage alive? I remain skeptical. Genuine change takes hard work and introspection. Falling back on old habits is always a lot easier.

Beyond the Drapers, Pete remains a favorite. Watching him jumping to and from different roles, always trying and always failing to prove himself, is quickly turning him into the underdog of the show. He's impatient, he's insecure, he's all over the place with his emotions, but goddamnit, I want to see him succeed in the end.

His marriage with Trudy continues to show just how little control he really has. Say what you want about his ""hell's bells"" tantrum, but it would be frustrating for anybody to have all your reservations about something like adoption be treated like a silly thing and frequently dismissed. 

I kept wondering if he would ever find out about his parentage to Peggy's son, and he finally did in the finale, in what was probably the most emotional scene of the show so far. Where will he go now?

And then there's Peggy. An essential character this season. From Father Gill, to Don, to Joan, to the European gay guy, impressions are made on her that will shape her for the future.

But best of all was her interactions with Bobbie. She instructed her to act like an equal, to make her place in the world, not as one of the guys, but as a woman. With her gaining her own office by the end of the season, Peggy is set to break out more and more as a character.

Roger is great, as usual, but I feel his role was reduced from season 1. Even something that should be significant, like him leaving his wife for Jane, is largely just happening in the background.

But Joan is growing as a character at the same time. Between her brief task with proof-reading scripts, and her engagement to an increasingly unpleasant guy, she's gaining complexity beyond being the resident queen bee of the office.

The guys claim that ""Marilyn is really a Joan"", and Marilyn turns out to be someone she cared about in a great scene after her suicide. ""This world destroyed her"" she says. Beyond all the apperances and power plays, it takes a toll on you to live like Joan does.

Harry turned out to be a great little side character with his TV department. 

Sal was given more flashes of depth with his closeted life.

Paul becomes unbearable with his attempts at being profound. Claiming he cancelled the California trip to attend the rally? He's full of shit.

And then there's Duck of course. A new important character of the season. With the impending merger and his waning patience with Don, he's shaping up to even more important. 

I said in my last post that the early 60s mostly feel like an extension of the 50s. This remains mostly true in season 2 as well, but here we really begin to see the last remnants of the 50s unravel, in keeping with the recurring them of shattered illusions. The missile crisis, the death of Marilyn, Peggy's haircut, the coffee-song the Smiths come up with (when thinking young), the signs of the decade that's about to unfold are becoming more and more frequent. 

We have all probably had this moment when first watching a show, when a scene comes to an end and we're left with a feeling of ""man, I'm really falling in love with this show, huh?""

For me, that was, for some reason, the end of ""The Inheritence"". Don and Pete on a flight to Los Angeles, Telstar playing in the background as the credits come in. The show has earned my devotion now. Time to sit back and watch it hit its stride.

If I have to name a favorite episode, I will probably go with the finale; ""Meditations in an Emergency"". With the backdrop of the missile crisis, everything in the season comes to its head, and it pays off really well.

Overall, I feel I liked seasons 1 and 2 roughly equally. Is this the end of the beginning? Is the best yet to come? I'm gonna have to find out.

I'll make a post when I finish season 3, if interest remains alive for it.",17,"['This is a wonderful breakdown of the season, with some great (and accurate) insights. \n\nIs this the first watch for you?

Trudy, on the other hand, had no such issues: she lived her life completely in sync with her childhood elitist teachings - because she believed them to be true. \n\nHer loyalty to Pete, his career, his needs - also reflects an attitude where she truly believed in gender roles of society.  \n\nTowards the end of my second watching, I had developed a high respect for Pete and kind of started disliking Trudy a lot. Put another way, she‚Äôs the only major character on the show whom I would expect to be unabashedly racist in real life.\n\nPS: Please be respectful in your comments. I can see my opinion is unpopular on this thread.', 'Ooh this is really interesting! For me she was in a really similar situation to Betty and handled it a lot better. Disappointed by the promises of marriage she grew up on. Trudy collected herself and made her life what she wanted and Betty took her problems out on everyone instead. Trudy put her kid first, which I respected a lot and feel like a lot of women at the time (and today even) wouldn‚Äôt do.\n\nI‚Äôm super surprised by her seeming one of the most racist to you. I felt like Pete is one of the less prejudiced characters on the show by the end, and from their post-assassination talks they seemed to be in a similar page on social issues. I might totally be missing something though. This is also not to say that she wasn‚Äôt 100% classist and racist - really every white person on the show was.', 'Yes to your comparison between Betty &amp; Trudy. I agree that Betty was way less of an adult that Trudy was (vis-a-vis her kid for example), even though they both had internalised their upbringing to a certain extent. \n\nBut only Betty (maybe because of her raging immaturity) is shown to question the status quo - like her beginning a career against her mother‚Äôs wishes, and struggling to get back to modelling afterwards, seeing a shrink against her husband‚Äôs wishes, shooting those birds, going to the city to rescue that violin girl, etc - she had courage and enough grit to do that. \n\nTrudy would not only not do any of those things (or do them differently), I feel she would judge the crap out of Betty for doing all that. \n\nAs for post-assassination episode (just actually had to watch the clip from that episode) - I mean that talk is very short to say anything about Trudy. \n\nI guess I‚Äôm just being overtly liberal with filling out the blanks, because Trudy is a truly supporting character on the show - we don‚Äôt see her outside of Pete‚Äôs shadow, so the show never spends any time in rounding out her character. She exists, only to be ‚Äòthe other side of Pete‚Äô.', 'Yeah I think we just have super different reads which is completely fair. Based on what little we see of Trudy, I totally could see her doing any of those things Betty did, and with better motivations too haha. We are both having to draw conclusions with very little info though. Anyway, thank you for the conversation! Was getting tired of ‚ÄúTrudy is hot‚Äù lol', 'I think Betty only ever did all those things because of her need for external validation. Trudy was confident and never seemed to put herself down or let anyone else put her down; the only thing she really struggled with emotionally was trying to get pregnant (and of course Pete cheating, but again she showed maturity in how she handled that).', 'Kind of disagree. Yes, Betty functioned purely on external validation - but many of the things like going to look for the violin girl or going to see a psychiatrist or studying psychology herself - were none of the things she did to impress anyone. Although sure, her modelling obsession obviously shows her need for validation. \n\nComing back to Trudy, in the episode where she finally tells Pete to leave (after he messes up with their neighbour) - she makes it very clear that she was aware of his sleeping around, that‚Äôs why she agreed to let him get an apartment in the city, so she could save face in society. In fact, the only reason she didn‚Äôt give Pete a divorce was because she didn‚Äôt want that label and society judging her that way. \n\nMeanwhile Betty was very oblivious to Don‚Äôs cheating, until she found out hard evidence. And she had the balls to get a divorce - in those moments she didn‚Äôt care about society‚Äôs validation.\n\nNot to mention their marriages. Trudy would never have married someone like Don as a young man.', 'I sort of disagree. Something I always got from the violin girl story was that Betty thought the girl would be ingratiated to her and be a kind of replacement daughter, as in receive some validation about being a good mom that she didn‚Äôt really get from Sally. She was far nicer to that girl than she would have been to Sally if she‚Äôd failed at something. \n\nAlso, Betty wasn‚Äôt ballsy enough to simply get a divorce. She slept with that random guy at the bar when she first found out she was pregnant with Gene, for a number of reasons: 1) to mentally and physically confirm that she was done with Don, 2) that other men still found her that attractive - which she already knows but needs constant reminders of, and 3) weird sense of doom about the Cuban missile crisis or whatever they were worried about in that episode. She also lined up Henry to marry immediately after. Trudy may not have gotten a divorce but she didn‚Äôt sleep with other men to validate her decision and openly kicked Pete out and kept up no pretenses about why. \n\nTrudy appeared to have always thought carefully and clearly about what she was doing and why, with Betty it was really never so.', 'I think we‚Äôre getting off-point here. My purpose of comparing Trudy with Betty was not to pit them against each other, but to establish a reference point for Trudy as she shares a very similar background to Betty. And despite her many, many flaws, Betty always challenged the status quo when she didn‚Äôt agree with it, but Trudy never did. \n\nAlso, I admit it is kind of unfair to compare the two as we know so much more about Betty than Trudy. \n\nHaving said that, I don‚Äôt see how internalising your husband‚Äôs philandering ([please see this](https://youtu.be/vTkSFUR9_BM)) for the very sake of keeping up pretences because - divorce is a ‚Äúfailure‚Äù - is a respectful decision. Let‚Äôs not forget, Trudy already knew about Pete cheating on her way before Tammy was even born - so she was clearly okay with denial over divorce.

Peggy wearing pantyhose instead of stockings, showcasing her ""modern working woman way"". She cares more about being comfortable and practical than sexy. If I read into it a tad too literally, she's putting another barrier between her sexual parts and the world.
But on Joan I can't even think of anything remarkable about the way she dresses, which is kind of surprising to me, because JOAN IN HER UNDERWEAR should be a huge deal (I don't mean it in the creepy way that Christina is hot, which of course she is, but in that Joan's character is very defined by her sexuality)

It‚Äôs something he‚Äôs always searching for.', 'Like the other comments said, Don‚Äôs childhood growing up in a brothel definitely influenced his feelings towards sex and he knows that it can be transactional. \n\nBut for Betty, I think her views towards sex were influenced by cultural and gender norms of the era she grew up in as well.

Women were shamed if they slept around, the main idea being that the only person a woman should ever sleep with was her husband (someone she‚Äôs emotionally close to.)

Like a lot of abuse survivors, Don sees his sexual performance as a way of proving his worth.', 'I also think that for Don, because of his sexual trauma, he is most likely using sex as an escape and probably isn‚Äôt all the way present. I don‚Äôt doubt that he enjoys sex, but his dialogue here suggests that he doesn‚Äôt it see the physical connection of sex as intimacy.

The second season is where the show really comes into its own - becoming more of an American family chronicle than just a mob show.

,"Finished watching season 2 for the first time, here are my thoughts","Some of you might remember this post I made a while back about my first watch of season 1: https://www.reddit.com/r/madmen/comments/revegy/first_watch_finished_season_1_here_are_my/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

Well, as promised, I'm here now with my thoughts about season 2. I'm sorry it took so long, I don't like binge-watching. Will try to be faster next time

So, I've been watching through all the big, acclaimed TV shows in the last few years; Game of Thrones, The Sopranos, The Wire, Breaking Bad, and so on. What I've noticed is that season 2 is often the slowest season. It's the one where the show has to take the initial premise introduced in the first season, consolidate it, expand it, and give it the depth required as a foundation for the rest of the show.

And season 2 of Mad Men is no different. It took everything I liked from season 2 and gave it all the more focus. But it definitely took its time in doing so. In many ways it felt transitionary; taking stock of the previous season and preparing us for what's to come.

Where it did really well was, once again, the characters. They already showed a lot of promise in the first season, and here is where they really start to come alive and feel real.

Let's start with Don himself. When I first started watching, he felt like a man who, all things considered, was in charge of himself. He knew life, knew himself, he was in control.

The more I watch, the more that illusion begins to crumble. Is he really in charge of himself if he can give certain instructions for an ad design in one moment, and completely change his mind the next? Is he really in control if he compulsively jumps from one affair to the next, with little thought about the consequences, both external and internal?

Sure, he has mastered the art of deception, of creating, selling and maintaining a narrative on the spot. Living with a fake identity probably teaches you some of that. But any reminder of the truth can shake him and throw him off. The scene where Sally's words brings him to think of Bobbie when shaving one morning really brought this home. 

This becomes all the more evident in the last couple of episodes, when Betty throws him out of the house. The idea that the little world he has created with his family could fall apart genuinely terrifies him. Does he love Betty, does he care about being a good father, a family man? It's doubtful, but he definitely wants to maintain that self image. 

Speaking of Betty, she was probably the standout character of the season. Much like Don, she's eager to maintain the appearance of domestic bliss. But she can't do it by herself, and when she's confronted with the reality of his latest affair, she literally throws up. Sure, their marriage wasn't perfect, but she tried, for him. He couldn't try for her.

With the horses, the seperation, and even her own little affair in the finale, she's slowly forcing herself to take some agency in a life that didn't turn out like she expected. Giving up the illusions she's lived by is hard, but it's becoming the only way forward. With the impending loss of her father, and her disillusionement with Don, she's going to have to learn to live on her own accord.

As of the finale, it seems like their teased divorce might not come to be. Will Don make the effort to keep their marriage alive? I remain skeptical. Genuine change takes hard work and introspection. Falling back on old habits is always a lot easier.

Beyond the Drapers, Pete remains a favorite. Watching him jumping to and from different roles, always trying and always failing to prove himself, is quickly turning him into the underdog of the show. He's impatient, he's insecure, he's all over the place with his emotions, but goddamnit, I want to see him succeed in the end.

His marriage with Trudy continues to show just how little control he really has. Say what you want about his ""hell's bells"" tantrum, but it would be frustrating for anybody to have all your reservations about something like adoption be treated like a silly thing and frequently dismissed. 

I kept wondering if he would ever find out about his parentage to Peggy's son, and he finally did in the finale, in what was probably the most emotional scene of the show so far. Where will he go now?

And then there's Peggy. An essential character this season. From Father Gill, to Don, to Joan, to the European gay guy, impressions are made on her that will shape her for the future.

But best of all was her interactions with Bobbie. She instructed her to act like an equal, to make her place in the world, not as one of the guys, but as a woman. With her gaining her own office by the end of the season, Peggy is set to break out more and more as a character.

Roger is great, as usual, but I feel his role was reduced from season 1. Even something that should be significant, like him leaving his wife for Jane, is largely just happening in the background.

But Joan is growing as a character at the same time. Between her brief task with proof-reading scripts, and her engagement to an increasingly unpleasant guy, she's gaining complexity beyond being the resident queen bee of the office.

The guys claim that ""Marilyn is really a Joan"", and Marilyn turns out to be someone she cared about in a great scene after her suicide. ""This world destroyed her"" she says. Beyond all the apperances and power plays, it takes a toll on you to live like Joan does.

Harry turned out to be a great little side character with his TV department. 

Sal was given more flashes of depth with his closeted life.

Paul becomes unbearable with his attempts at being profound. Claiming he cancelled the California trip to attend the rally? He's full of shit.

And then there's Duck of course. A new important character of the season. With the impending merger and his waning patience with Don, he's shaping up to even more important. 

I said in my last post that the early 60s mostly feel like an extension of the 50s. This remains mostly true in season 2 as well, but here we really begin to see the last remnants of the 50s unravel, in keeping with the recurring them of shattered illusions. The missile crisis, the death of Marilyn, Peggy's haircut, the coffee-song the Smiths come up with (when thinking young), the signs of the decade that's about to unfold are becoming more and more frequent. 

We have all probably had this moment when first watching a show, when a scene comes to an end and we're left with a feeling of ""man, I'm really falling in love with this show, huh?""

For me, that was, for some reason, the end of ""The Inheritence"". Don and Pete on a flight to Los Angeles, Telstar playing in the background as the credits come in. The show has earned my devotion now. Time to sit back and watch it hit its stride.

If I have to name a favorite episode, I will probably go with the finale; ""Meditations in an Emergency"". With the backdrop of the missile crisis, everything in the season comes to its head, and it pays off really well.

Overall, I feel I liked seasons 1 and 2 roughly equally. Is this the end of the beginning? Is the best yet to come? I'm gonna have to find out.

I'll make a post when I finish season 3, if interest remains alive for it.",17,"['This is a wonderful breakdown of the season, with some great (and accurate) insights. \n\nIs this the first watch for you? I‚Äôm always interested to see peoples opinions from their first watch.', 'It is my first watch, as I say in the title ;)', 'Hahaha I‚Äôm a real Kinsey for not noticing that detail. \n\nIt‚Äôs a great show, I think you‚Äôll really enjoy the next few seasons.', ""Yes please, do continue to embrace and enjoy it, and do please continue to post.\n\nI really value the other voices opining here, but understandably, peeps are brief.\n\nSo it was all for the better to read your lengthier posting 1&amp;2, partly cuz I personally struggle to truly understand why I like, to the point of obsession, just why it is that I love it so much.\n\nReading your fine insights helps me 're assemble' the show as well as my thoughts about it - and how the period and how the show influences both.\n\nKeep going!"", 'I\'m also a big fan of S2, slow as it can be. ""Meditations"" and ""Six Month Leave"" are two all-time episodes IMO. Betty\'s rise in this season is a highlight as you noted, the scene with her and a Arthur in the stables is fantastic.\n\nOften overlooked and maybe worth going back to rewatch - one of my favorite scenes in the entire show is with Peggy, Don, and Sal from the first episode of the season - ""What Did You Bring Me Daddy?"" for Mohawk. Really shows the essence of Don and Peggy\'s bond. https://youtu.be/M-EjMfcY7A4 starts at 3:05\n\nLooking forward to your thoughts on S3!', 'The scene you mention is actually something I was hinting to when giving my thougts on Don; ""Is he really in charge of himself if he can give certain instructions for an ad design in one moment, and completely change his mind the next?""\n\nFirst he wanted to go for a sexy flight attendant angle, but then he was suddenly adamant about changing it to the ""what did you bring me daddy?"" angle.\n\nIt shows his inner conflicts well I think.

He listens to others‚Äô ideas, and helps turn them into something even better.', 'Season 2 is definitely the end of the beginning, paired maybe with the first half of season 3.\n\n\nFor me, the show reaches a critical mass in season 3 where even the slower episodes are incredibly interesting because of the intimate knowledge of character motivations you have by then.\n\nPlus there are crazy good pay-off eps about halfway through the season and at the finale. \n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts on season 3!', 'In my opinion, this show gets better and better each season so you have a lot to look forward to!', 'I love your breakdown and insights!

They moved a lot of plot forward and the scenes just sizzled. I like UTz guy calling Don out. \n\nAgreed this season feels like the end / last gasps of the fifties. It‚Äôs season 3 where it starts to feel more like the sixties to me.  Please keep posting !', 'I was gonna mention the Barretts too, I felt the post getting overly long.\n\nBobbie was fun, I liked her interactions with Peggy as I mentioned. But I don\'t think she had a very interesting dynamic with Don, at least compared to Rachel from season 1. She never felt like someone he would want in his life beyond a brief fling.\n\nJimmy was fun too. I liked seeing him take down Don about his affair with Bobbie; ""you\'re garbage, and you know it!"" Don punching him later felt like an outlet for how upset he was about his crumbling world at home.', 'The observation you made about early 60s being an extension of the 50s was very accurate. Without spoiling anything for you, I will say that the show does a fantastic job of showing how people and things change(or don‚Äôt) with the passage of time. The series ends in 1970 and you can already see all of the popular styles and fads of that decade beginning to creep in. It‚Äôs so masterfully done that going back to season 1 for a rewatch (which you WILL do,lol) will give you whiplash.', 'I really enjoyed reading this', 'I would love to continue reading your thoughts on the remaining seasons!', '!updateme!', 'Excellent breakdown!

,What do you read into this iconic scene?,"The most obvious symbolism to me is Betty looking at herself in the mirror, pushing her boobs up, always very concerned with the way she looks.
Peggy wearing pantyhose instead of stockings, showcasing her ""modern working woman way"". She cares more about being comfortable and practical than sexy. If I read into it a tad too literally, she's putting another barrier between her sexual parts and the world.
But on Joan I can't even think of anything remarkable about the way she dresses, which is kind of surprising to me, because JOAN IN HER UNDERWEAR should be a huge deal (I don't mean it in the creepy way that Christina is hot, which of course she is, but in that Joan's character is very defined by her sexuality)

To hide flaws and imperfections, to put forth an image of being put together and in charge. All the things people have to go through to convince themselves and others that they're not just falling a part inside. \n\nI'd also like to think this scene is a bit of a shout out to the costume designer as well:)"", 'No, stockings and a belt were way less comfortable than nylons.', 'Ah, I see', 'You need to read the Tom and Lorenzo Mad Style blog.

Trudy, on the other hand, had no such issues: she lived her life completely in sync with her childhood elitist teachings - because she believed them to be true. \n\nHer loyalty to Pete, his career, his needs - also reflects an attitude where she truly believed in gender roles of society.  \n\nTowards the end of my second watching, I had developed a high respect for Pete and kind of started disliking Trudy a lot. Put another way, she‚Äôs the only major character on the show whom I would expect to be unabashedly racist in real life.\n\nPS: Please be respectful in your comments. I can see my opinion is unpopular on this thread.', 'Ooh this is really interesting! For me she was in a really similar situation to Betty and handled it a lot better. Disappointed by the promises of marriage she grew up on. Trudy collected herself and made her life what she wanted and Betty took her problems out on everyone instead. Trudy put her kid first, which I respected a lot and feel like a lot of women at the time (and today even) wouldn‚Äôt do.\n\nI‚Äôm super surprised by her seeming one of the most racist to you. I felt like Pete is one of the less prejudiced characters on the show by the end, and from their post-assassination talks they seemed to be in a similar page on social issues. I might totally be missing something though. This is also not to say that she wasn‚Äôt 100% classist and racist - really every white person on the show was.', 'Yes to your comparison between Betty &amp; Trudy. I agree that Betty was way less of an adult that Trudy was (vis-a-vis her kid for example), even though they both had internalised their upbringing to a certain extent. \n\nBut only Betty (maybe because of her raging immaturity) is shown to question the status quo - like her beginning a career against her mother‚Äôs wishes, and struggling to get back to modelling afterwards, seeing a shrink against her husband‚Äôs wishes, shooting those birds, going to the city to rescue that violin girl, etc - she had courage and enough grit to do that. \n\nTrudy would not only not do any of those things (or do them differently), I feel she would judge the crap out of Betty for doing all that. \n\nAs for post-assassination episode (just actually had to watch the clip from that episode) - I mean that talk is very short to say anything about Trudy. \n\nI guess I‚Äôm just being overtly liberal with filling out the blanks, because Trudy is a truly supporting character on the show - we don‚Äôt see her outside of Pete‚Äôs shadow, so the show never spends any time in rounding out her character. She exists, only to be ‚Äòthe other side of Pete‚Äô.', 'Yeah I think we just have super different reads which is completely fair. Based on what little we see of Trudy, I totally could see her doing any of those things Betty did, and with better motivations too haha. We are both having to draw conclusions with very little info though. Anyway, thank you for the conversation! Was getting tired of ‚ÄúTrudy is hot‚Äù lol', 'I think Betty only ever did all those things because of her need for external validation. Trudy was confident and never seemed to put herself down or let anyone else put her down; the only thing she really struggled with emotionally was trying to get pregnant (and of course Pete cheating, but again she showed maturity in how she handled that).', 'Kind of disagree. Yes, Betty functioned purely on external validation - but many of the things like going to look for the violin girl or going to see a psychiatrist or studying psychology herself - were none of the things she did to impress anyone. Although sure, her modelling obsession obviously shows her need for validation. \n\nComing back to Trudy, in the episode where she finally tells Pete to leave (after he messes up with their neighbour) - she makes it very clear that she was aware of his sleeping around, that‚Äôs why she agreed to let him get an apartment in the city, so she could save face in society. In fact, the only reason she didn‚Äôt give Pete a divorce was because she didn‚Äôt want that label and society judging her that way. \n\nMeanwhile Betty was very oblivious to Don‚Äôs cheating, until she found out hard evidence. And she had the balls to get a divorce - in those moments she didn‚Äôt care about society‚Äôs validation.\n\nNot to mention their marriages. Trudy would never have married someone like Don as a young man.', 'I sort of disagree. Something I always got from the violin girl story was that Betty thought the girl would be ingratiated to her and be a kind of replacement daughter, as in receive some validation about being a good mom that she didn‚Äôt really get from Sally. She was far nicer to that girl than she would have been to Sally if she‚Äôd failed at something. \n\nAlso, Betty wasn‚Äôt ballsy enough to simply get a divorce. She slept with that random guy at the bar when she first found out she was pregnant with Gene, for a number of reasons: 1) to mentally and physically confirm that she was done with Don, 2) that other men still found her that attractive - which she already knows but needs constant reminders of, and 3) weird sense of doom about the Cuban missile crisis or whatever they were worried about in that episode. She also lined up Henry to marry immediately after. Trudy may not have gotten a divorce but she didn‚Äôt sleep with other men to validate her decision and openly kicked Pete out and kept up no pretenses about why. \n\nTrudy appeared to have always thought carefully and clearly about what she was doing and why, with Betty it was really never so.', 'I think we‚Äôre getting off-point here. My purpose of comparing Trudy with Betty was not to pit them against each other, but to establish a reference point for Trudy as she shares a very similar background to Betty. And despite her many, many flaws, Betty always challenged the status quo when she didn‚Äôt agree with it, but Trudy never did. \n\nAlso, I admit it is kind of unfair to compare the two as we know so much more about Betty than Trudy. \n\nHaving said that, I don‚Äôt see how internalising your husband‚Äôs philandering ([please see this](https://youtu.be/vTkSFUR9_BM)) for the very sake of keeping up pretences because - divorce is a ‚Äúfailure‚Äù - is a respectful decision. Let‚Äôs not forget, Trudy already knew about Pete cheating on her way before Tammy was even born - so she was clearly okay with denial over divorce. Not very mature in my books. \n\nYour line of thinking may obviously be different than mine, but that is just a calculative move to stay in uptight high-snobbery bubble - one I don‚Äôt respect.', 'If we are going to talk about calculated moves, lining up another husband before getting rid of the first is shady as hell too. That definitely kept Betty in the socioeconomic status she was accustomed to. But that‚Äôs besides the point. \n\nDon‚Äôt get me wrong, I love them both. Trudy is very much a foil to Betty imo. I just think she is able to process and handle things better and does a better job of straddling the line between regressive and progressive. She does seem to be the perfect housewife, but a ‚Äútraditional‚Äù woman would not approach her issues from the perspective that Trudy did. I think a large part of this is because she actually seems to have a good relationship with both her parents and none of the childhood trauma that Betty does. \n\nNeither is wrong in how they approach their life overall; it was a difficult time for women in general. They couldn‚Äôt exactly strike out on their own even if they wanted to, so they all kept up pretenses at least some of the time, but each did it at different times for different reasons.', 'She‚Äôs transparent in the best way. That‚Äôs her, all her. Genuine and good', 'To add to what others have said, I think she has the best morals of any character in the show. \n\nI can‚Äôt name a thing that she does wrong, when she would have been justified in taking the low road.', ""She perfectly balances great tenacity for being a woman in the 60s but also takes care of her man. She's a queen."", ""She's amazing in everything, including Princess Unikitty of Cloud Cuckoo Land!"", 'I think it‚Äôs because Alison Brie is hot as hell and palpably gives off Fuck me vibes', 'It‚Äôs Allison Brie dude. Hard not to love any of her characters. But on the real Trudy is such a sweet, loving wife. She‚Äôs patient and does so much for Pete, who‚Äôs pretty much a piece of shit through and through. She‚Äôs a 10/10', 'She‚Äôs attractive, loyal and at the same time, not afraid to put you in your place! Any man, person, who says they don‚Äôt admire that last quality is **lying**', 'i have always found it odd that people (mostly men in my experience but idk) are so obsessed with her, and the fact that many commenters are citing her ‚Äúloyalty‚Äù slightly rubs me the wrong way. I don‚Äôt think she has enough character development to warrant the obsession and she spent most of the series being a doormat  ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø', 'Thank you! Absolutely. I felt she was the least modern character in the show. Although she was truly a picture of how you‚Äôd expect a suburban housewife in the 60s to be like.', 'She‚Äôs very, very attractive. No need to overthink this.', 'Lol all the women in this show are stunning, and I do not like their characters as much. She is beautiful, though, yes.', 'Sure, but Betty gives you a lot of reasons to be ambivalent (at best) about her. Joan is pretty damn likable, but we learn enough about her to also find her pretty complex, and a source of some concern. Trudy is on screen just often enough that we see Allison Brie‚Äôs considerable charm, but it never gives her enough of a plot line that we learn a lot of her deeper traits. \n\nAnd she must have other, darker personal traits to cope with being married to Pete for the entirety of the show. She seems smart enough to know who he is, and isn‚Äôt delusional. But the show never really goes down that road (am I mistaken? Maybe It did and I don‚Äôt recall.) Thus you are left with charming attractive person whose inner depth is hinted at but never actually explored.', 'This is the comment I was looking for. You‚Äôre a good overthinker haha. I think what was left out definitely made her more intriguing to me, and made the moments where we learned more (like the insane charleston scene) so rewarding. I like the show to a fault so it‚Äôs hard for me to think it‚Äôs flat writing rather than intentional.', 'Yeah, I wouldn‚Äôt call it flat writing. It‚Äôs just tough to give every single side character their own arc. You can try, but you risk pulling a Sopranos and spending 1.5 entire episodes with Vito and JohnnyCakes.', 'You‚Äôre absolutely right.', 'Bc Alison Brie is extremely attractive', 'Hot', 'She‚Äôs incredibly selfless and kind, loyal, funny, witty, and gorgeous. She‚Äôs perfect.', 'I found her a really flat, unbelievable character. I love Alison Brie in community and other things but I don‚Äôt think she fit the era in this role', 'She\'s a feminine woman yet still strong and powerful. She doesn\'t become bitter even though she totally has the ""right"" too, and stays loyal despite the risk. She understands life is hard and people aren\'t perfect. In a world today where women think he answer to life is to be more like men Trudy is a woman through and through and still has as much character and strength as any other character on the show. \n\nThe scene where they find out Pete has no problems with his sperm and then Trudy starts getting mad and then Pete says ""what do you want me to say? This had to be a possiblity right?,"" and then she says, ""Yes you are right. I""m just upset that\'s all and I really want a child."" I was blown away. Maybe I have bad experiences with women but if I was in Pete\'s shoes this whole issue would have still been my fault when in reality it\'s no ones fault. Pete is lucky to have her', ""I think she's basically Joan, if Joan had married a rich dude in her early 20's instead of entering the working world."", 'Alison Brie is attractive so I think that‚Äôs why people like her so much. But she was also racist and classist as fuck', 'She gives hope to shitty men that they can do whatever they want and be rewarded with a hot, loyal wife.', 'Trudy is ride or die.', 'I feel that is because she is the acctualy healthy character on the show', 'She soooo damn pretty', 'There‚Äôs two reasons I can‚Ä¶we‚Äôll wish I could put my finger on', 'Subservient', 'Because she‚Äôs perfect']"

,"Fellow MM, fanatics, should I watch The Sopranos?","I‚Äôm an absolute mad men addict. I love everything about it, have rewatched probably 6-7 times. I value your taste if you‚Äôre on here, and I‚Äôm wondering: is the Sopranos as good? I know that‚Äôs subjective but I hope you can get what I mean.

I tried watching the first season of sopranos but I couldn‚Äôt really get into it as well as mad men. I know Matthew Wiener was the writer, and I absolutely love his writing in mad men. Do you think I should give it another try?",113,"[""Wiener wasn't a writer on Sopranos until the 3rd or 4th season, but Sopranos is a great series.  It's importance can't be overstated, but it is very good storytelling and is very fun to watch.  \n\nI'd give it another go, but if you still can't get into it after the first season, give it up.  It's not a class assignment and everyone likes what they like."", 'that‚Äôs good to know, i‚Äôll try that approach. thanks!', 'You definitely need to watch beyond season 1 to get a good sense of the show though.  The first season is a lot closer to a traditional gangster story.  It has a lot more cliches/some weird plot holes (Tony is boss in the pilot but a capo in the second episode).  The second season is where the show really comes into its own - becoming more of an American family chronicle than just a mob show.  (And it really is so much more - the show explores everything from mental health and depression to gender relations and family dynamics to Freud, the Oedipus Complex, and the long term decline of the United States).  Also, some of the most fantastic writing/acting is towards the end of the show (especially season 6).\n\nThat said, the Sopranos is an acquired taste. I enjoyed it on my first watch through, but not as much as Mad Men or Breaking Bad/Better Call Saul (my other favorite shows).  I really began to appreciate it on my second rewatch.', 'yeah season 2 is def where the show starts finding its footing eventually leading to its legendary status....', 'Tony isn\'t the boss in the pilot episode of the Sopranos?

He's still responsible for an area and still can't just overrule Junior."", ""I think it's more that South Jersey is a separate family.

But I did feel, on subsequent rewatch, to be a little...

For some reason the show lost me in S3 with Walt‚Äôs transformation. In S2 he breaks down and cries when he sees Jane die. Then in S3 he suddenly runs over two drug dealers with his car and shoots one in the head. Seemed like a big leap especially considering those events are only a couple months apart. \n\nAlso, the passage of time being only a year from Pilot to early S5 is too little. I understand his life expectancy was short, but I found it hard to believe a person could change that drastically in a single year.', 'Sopranos and Mad Men are definitely my top two, in that order, but I would place The Wire and The Americans above The Leftovers in my Top 5.', 'Have you watched Six Feet Under?', 'I think most people would definitely agree with you that Season 5 of the Wire was the weakest.  Fantastic show but the serial killer plotline really derailed the last season', 'wow that‚Äôs awesome! i will definitely try it in that case.', 'I watched the first season of The Wire. It depressed the hell out of me.', 'Oh yeah. The whole series, while wonderful and full of great characters and, is also ... sad and hopeless ultimately.', 'Ironically I find Mad Men more depressing.

My top 3 is Mad Men #1 followed by The Wire and the sopranos in a tie for second but an arms length behind Mad Men.

Also if you're looking for a not too long of a series The Deuce on HBO Max is only 3 seasons about the fall of the pimp game and the rise of porn in manhattan in the decade of the 70's.

Or a really fun character for Peggy to do scenes with.\n\nEdit: I accidentally forgot Paul but that‚Äôs probably bc i hate him', 'He could be one of the new art staff. Harry basically asks him quasi-racist things, Sal is into him (and he might be a little into him too), Ken and him become Troy and Abed styled life partners, and Pete becomes protective over him and jealous of Ken.', 'Spot on.', 'On a madmen Instagram account I follow, they posted all of Trudy\'s greatest moments bc it\'s Allison\'s birthday. Trudy is very ahead of her time but also so classy. She is quick-witted and easily likable. I love her character as well... ""I\'m not able to be sentimental of the past, I remember things as they were"" classic.', 'I may get a lot of flak for this, but anyone with an open-mind is welcome to comment. üòä\n\nWe like Trudy because unlike every other character on the show, we don‚Äôt see Trudy dealing with anything outside of her rich, elite bubble. \n\nI absolutely LOVED Trudy during my first watch, but in subsequent watches it became more and more clear that Trudy was possibly the one character in the 25-45 age group who was 100% regressive, more than even Betty. \n\nBetty always struggled with syncing her conservative elitist upbringing with her modern present, and that‚Äôs what led to her life‚Äôs sadness. Trudy, on the other hand, had no such issues: she lived her life completely in sync with her childhood elitist teachings - because she believed them to be true. \n\nHer loyalty to Pete, his career, his needs - also reflects an attitude where she truly believed in gender roles of society.  \n\nTowards the end of my second watching, I had developed a high respect for Pete and kind of started disliking Trudy a lot. Put another way, she‚Äôs the only major character on the show whom I would expect to be unabashedly racist in real life.\n\nPS: Please be respectful in your comments. I can see my opinion is unpopular on this thread.', 'Ooh this is really interesting! For me she was in a really similar situation to Betty and handled it a lot better. Disappointed by the promises of marriage she grew up on. Trudy collected herself and made her life what she wanted and Betty took her problems out on everyone instead. Trudy put her kid first, which I respected a lot and feel like a lot of women at the time (and today even) wouldn‚Äôt do.\n\nI‚Äôm super surprised by her seeming one of the most racist to you. I felt like Pete is one of the less prejudiced characters on the show by the end, and from their post-assassination talks they seemed to be in a similar page on social issues. I might totally be missing something though. This is also not to say that she wasn‚Äôt 100% classist and racist - really every white person on the show was.', 'Yes to your comparison between Betty &amp; Trudy. I agree that Betty was way less of an adult that Trudy was (vis-a-vis her kid for example), even though they both had internalised their upbringing to a certain extent. \n\nBut only Betty (maybe because of her raging immaturity) is shown to question the status quo - like her beginning a career against her mother‚Äôs wishes, and struggling to get back to modelling afterwards, seeing a shrink against her husband‚Äôs wishes, shooting those birds, going to the city to rescue that violin girl, etc - she had courage and enough grit to do that. \n\nTrudy would not only not do any of those things (or do them differently), I feel she would judge the crap out of Betty for doing all that. \n\nAs for post-assassination episode (just actually had to watch the clip from that episode) - I mean that talk is very short to say anything about Trudy. \n\nI guess I‚Äôm just being overtly liberal with filling out the blanks, because Trudy is a truly supporting character on the show - we don‚Äôt see her outside of Pete‚Äôs shadow, so the show never spends any time in rounding out her character. She exists, only to be ‚Äòthe other side of Pete‚Äô.', 'Yeah I think we just have super different reads which is completely fair. Based on what little we see of Trudy, I totally could see her doing any of those things Betty did, and with better motivations too haha. We are both having to draw conclusions with very little info though. Anyway, thank you for the conversation! Was getting tired of ‚ÄúTrudy is hot‚Äù lol', 'I think Betty only ever did all those things because of her need for external validation. Trudy was confident and never seemed to put herself down or let anyone else put her down; the only thing she really struggled with emotionally was trying to get pregnant (and of course Pete cheating, but again she showed maturity in how she handled that).', 'Kind of disagree. Yes, Betty functioned purely on external validation - but many of the things like going to look for the violin girl or going to see a psychiatrist or studying psychology herself - were none of the things she did to impress anyone. Although sure, her modelling obsession obviously shows her need for validation. \n\nComing back to Trudy, in the episode where she finally tells Pete to leave (after he messes up with their neighbour) - she makes it very clear that she was aware of his sleeping around, that‚Äôs why she agreed to let him get an apartment in the city, so she could save face in society. In fact, the only reason she didn‚Äôt give Pete a divorce was because she didn‚Äôt want that label and society judging her that way. \n\nMeanwhile Betty was very oblivious to Don‚Äôs cheating, until she found out hard evidence. And she had the balls to get a divorce - in those moments she didn‚Äôt care about society‚Äôs validation.\n\nNot to mention their marriages. Trudy would never have married someone like Don as a young man.', 'I sort of disagree. Something I always got from the violin girl story was that Betty thought the girl would be ingratiated to her and be a kind of replacement daughter, as in receive some validation about being a good mom that she didn‚Äôt really get from Sally. She was far nicer to that girl than she would have been to Sally if she‚Äôd failed at something. \n\nAlso, Betty wasn‚Äôt ballsy enough to simply get a divorce. She slept with that random guy at the bar when she first found out she was pregnant with Gene, for a number of reasons: 1) to mentally and physically confirm that she was done with Don, 2) that other men still found her that attractive - which she already knows but needs constant reminders of, and 3) weird sense of doom about the Cuban missile crisis or whatever they were worried about in that episode. She also lined up Henry to marry immediately after. Trudy may not have gotten a divorce but she didn‚Äôt sleep with other men to validate her decision and openly kicked Pete out and kept up no pretenses about why. \n\nTrudy appeared to have always thought carefully and clearly about what she was doing and why, with Betty it was really never so.', 'I think we‚Äôre getting off-point here. My purpose of comparing Trudy with Betty was not to pit them against each other, but to establish a reference point for Trudy as she shares a very similar background to Betty. And despite her many, many flaws, Betty always challenged the status quo when she didn‚Äôt agree with it, but Trudy never did. \n\nAlso, I admit it is kind of unfair to compare the two as we know so much more about Betty than Trudy. \n\nHaving said that, I don‚Äôt see how internalising your husband‚Äôs philandering ([please see this](https://youtu.be/vTkSFUR9_BM)) for the very sake of keeping up pretences because - divorce is a ‚Äúfailure‚Äù - is a respectful decision. Let‚Äôs not forget, Trudy already knew about Pete cheating on her way before Tammy was even born - so she was clearly okay with denial over divorce. Not very mature in my books. \n\nYour line of thinking may obviously be different than mine, but that is just a calculative move to stay in uptight high-snobbery bubble - one I don‚Äôt respect.', 'If we are going to talk about calculated moves, lining up another husband before getting rid of the first is shady as hell too. That definitely kept Betty in the socioeconomic status she was accustomed to. But that‚Äôs besides the point. \n\nDon‚Äôt get me wrong, I love them both. Trudy is very much a foil to Betty imo. I just think she is able to process and handle things better and does a better job of straddling the line between regressive and progressive. She does seem to be the perfect housewife, but a ‚Äútraditional‚Äù woman would not approach her issues from the perspective that Trudy did. I think a large part of this is because she actually seems to have a good relationship with both her parents and none of the childhood trauma that Betty does. \n\nNeither is wrong in how they approach their life overall; it was a difficult time for women in general. They couldn‚Äôt exactly strike out on their own even if they wanted to, so they all kept up pretenses at least some of the time, but each did it at different times for different reasons.', 'She‚Äôs transparent in the best way. That‚Äôs her, all her. Genuine and good', 'To add to what others have said, I think she has the best morals of any character in the show. \n\nI can‚Äôt name a thing that she does wrong, when she would have been justified in taking the low road.', ""She perfectly balances great tenacity for being a woman in the 60s but also takes care of her man. She's a queen."", ""She's amazing in everything, including Princess Unikitty of Cloud Cuckoo Land!"", 'I think it‚Äôs because Alison Brie is hot as hell and palpably gives off Fuck me vibes', 'It‚Äôs Allison Brie dude.

Any man, person, who says they don‚Äôt admire that last quality is **lying**', 'i have always found it odd that people (mostly men in my experience but idk) are so obsessed with her, and the fact that many commenters are citing her ‚Äúloyalty‚Äù slightly rubs me the wrong way.

No need to overthink this.', 'Lol all the women in this show are stunning, and I do not like their characters as much. She is beautiful, though, yes.', 'Sure, but Betty gives you a lot of reasons to be ambivalent (at best) about her. Joan is pretty damn likable, but we learn enough about her to also find her pretty complex, and a source of some concern. Trudy is on screen just often enough that we see Allison Brie‚Äôs considerable charm, but it never gives her enough of a plot line that we learn a lot of her deeper traits. \n\nAnd she must have other, darker personal traits to cope with being married to Pete for the entirety of the show. She seems smart enough to know who he is, and isn‚Äôt delusional. But the show never really goes down that road (am I mistaken? Maybe It did and I don‚Äôt recall.) Thus you are left with charming attractive person whose inner depth is hinted at but never actually explored.', 'This is the comment I was looking for. You‚Äôre a good overthinker haha. I think what was left out definitely made her more intriguing to me, and made the moments where we learned more (like the insane charleston scene) so rewarding. I like the show to a fault so it‚Äôs hard for me to think it‚Äôs flat writing rather than intentional.', 'Yeah, I wouldn‚Äôt call it flat writing. It‚Äôs just tough to give every single side character their own arc.

She doesn\'t become bitter even though she totally has the ""right"" too, and stays loyal despite the risk. She understands life is hard and people aren\'t perfect. In a world today where women think he answer to life is to be more like men Trudy is a woman through and through and still has as much character and strength as any other character on the show. \n\nThe scene where they find out Pete has no problems with his sperm and then Trudy starts getting mad and then Pete says ""what do you want me to say?

But she was also racist and classist as fuck', 'She gives hope to shitty men that they can do whatever they want and be rewarded with a hot, loyal wife.', 'Trudy is ride or die.', 'I feel that is because she is the acctualy healthy character on the show', 'She soooo damn pretty', 'There‚Äôs two reasons I can‚Ä¶we‚Äôll wish I could put my finger on', 'Subservient', 'Because she‚Äôs perfect']"

,Is Don a bad father?,"I‚Äôm on my 4th rewatch (I‚Äôm a half-watcher with my comfort shows, so forgive me if my details are hazy). In my head I have‚Äîfor years‚Äîcompartmentalized Don as a terrible husband and father. But now I actually think he‚Äôs an okay father (and obviously still a shitty husband).

-He kisses and hugs his all his kids, not just Sally. This is actually not all that common for a man of his generation even if he HAD been shown affection as a child. My mother (a boomer) has mentioned that her father never hugged her brothers especially because he didn‚Äôt want to make them ‚Äúsoft‚Äù. An occasional pat on the head was all they got.

-When all is considered, I think Don had far more substantial conversations with his kids, at least with Sally. Betty does have a few, but a lot of them had an ulterior motive (for example, she was very open with Sally about her first period, but then she gleefully called Megan to rub it in that ‚ÄúShe just needed her mother.‚Äù)

-Don refuses to hit his kids, which was pretty radical for the time (although we did see him shove/grab both of his wives).

-Don listens to the kids. Where Betty just assumed Sally was jealous of the baby, Don had an actual discussion with her and determined that Sally was actually afraid of the baby.

-Don chose his wife partly based on who would be a more suitable stepmother for his kids.

-Don seems to understand that they‚Äôre children who need patience better than Betty does.

I‚Äôm not in the habit of giving bare-minimum parents ass-pats, but bar was just so much lower for fathers back then AND Don was the product of a loveless and abusive home. I hadn‚Äôt given him enough credit.

I was considering this against what is considered a good dad today, what was expected of a father back then, and what kind of parenting Dick himself had, and‚Äîwhile he certainly not a shining example of an attentive father‚Äîwhen he was there, he genuinely loved his kids and they knew that.

**And please don‚Äôt get me wrong; I love me some Betty Draper and this post isn‚Äôt a competition between the two of them, as Betty was also very much a mother of her time. But I think when everything is weighed, Don was the better parent.",128,"[""In my opinion, above all else, kids need parents to be there for them through good and bad. It doesn't matter if you hug and kiss them the one time you see them for weeks. Kids shouldn't be hit but not doing so doesn't make Don a great parent. I guess that was how little was expected of men at the time but good dads of the time, like my grandfather, had a demanding job but still came home every night for dinner and spent time with the family. Don could have gone home everyday, his work was an excuse, he only sporadically went home or got home late by his own choice.\n\nIn summary, I think Don was a bad parent as he was rarely there for the kids so much so that when Betty dies he isn't capable of raising them and is told as much by both Betty and Sally. Betty, at least she was there but really the nanny Carla was the best parent. The kids could always count on her, until she was fired."", 'Agree.  I grew up in the 70s,  my Dad travelled and worked a lot but he was always there when he said he would be and available if we needed him.   My parents divorced so we saw him less but he was consistent and we could always count on him to follow through. I consider him to have been a very good parent.', 'My Dad once commented, having grown up during the 70s and 80s, that his father always had the attitude that ‚Äúmy kids know that if they ever need me, all they have to do is call and I‚Äôll be there‚Äù, as such he had a similar mindset early on until he realised its not enough to just be there when your kids SAY they need you, because they usually won‚Äôt, you just need to BE THERE, all the time no matter what', 'You can love your kids but still be a bad parent. I believe this to be the case with Don.', 'Absolutely. Love is necessary but it‚Äôs not enough.', ""He leaves them for weeks at a time, frequently not just once,  and doesn't tell them or their mother where, why, or for how long. Kisses and chocolate milk do not make up for that. After the divorce, he'd consistently miss time with the kids because of women and benders. While married, he would often not be there at night or the next day, with zero explanation. This doesn't include the extended unexplained absences mentioned above.\n\nBetty was consistently there, even if cold and resentful about having to be there while Don did as he pleased.  She didn't leave. And when she dies, she knows her children are better off with their aunt and uncle. Sally knows this, too and tells Don not to come for them. Don did fine when he was there, but there were way too many times that he was just gone and that puts him below the bar of the average father of that time."", 'Just to nitpick, Sally wants them to stay with Henry and asks Don to back her up on this.

Kisses do not make up for being an absentee parent--they are often just an attempted to hide neglect.', 'Yep, he was also fine with running away with Rachel and abandoning the kids.', 'I think when he tried, he was a good parent. The way he interacted with the kids (especially Sally) was generally really nice to watch‚Äîon the rare occasion we got to see it. The worst part is that he just didn‚Äôt bother to try all that often. For better or for worse, Betty was there, and I do think she really cared about the kids, flawed as some of her methods may have been. But Don just not wanting to be bothered with his family was one of the most disappointing things about his character.', 'Sally clearly loves her father, but she also clearly resents him too. She resents him not often being there for her when she really needed him. She resented him often leaving her alone for women and alcohol. She may have gone out with him on trips every now and again, but she didn‚Äôt really have a role model who was always there for her.

He has some self awareness as to who he is as a parent and who he doesn‚Äôt want to be, but ultimately he never had the emotional tools (and never sought them out) to heal from his childhood scars and that is ultimately what makes him not a good father.\n\nWhen you become a parent, you think about your own childhood a lot. At least I have. My daughter is nearly 6. You tend to model your parenting behavior after your own parents unless you make a conscious effort not too. There are times I‚Äôve heard myself speak almost like an out of body experience. All the same venom and impatience my mom had for me. It‚Äôs really hard to break cycles and change. It‚Äôs something I constantly have to work on. Sometimes I fail, but I definitely do things differently. Hopefully better.\n\nI think that is to be a parent.

Longer answer, noooo.\n\nBetty is also pretty not great.', 'Betty also had zero support from don', 'Betty came to the battlefield of parenthood with a shovel and a water pistol', ""She had complete financial safety, a housekeeper/nanny and some support from Don (although I agree it could have been more).

Sure, he loved his kids, but he certainly didn\'t love them enough to be a stable figure in their lives. He wasn\'t just away for work.

Also, ""Don chose his wife partly based on who would be a more suitable stepmother for his kids,"" yeah, and then they divorced because of Don\'s actions. Yet another example of Don uprooting their life and being neglectful. Yes, Don is not a bad father when he is actually present, but he is hardly there by his own choice. The most telling example of Don\'s inability to parent is when Sally requests that they stay with Henry after Betty\'s death. Think about that for a second. Sally willingly decides to have the children stay with their stepfather instead of their father. Henry is a very busy man, yet he is there for them. That\'s the difference. All the hugs and money in the world can\'t replace time.', 'I feel 3 things about Don as a parent: \n\n1. He‚Äôs perfectly representative of his time. Midcentury American adults of both sexes were shitty parents, because they‚Äôd had shitty parents and they didn‚Äôt yet have the choice NOT to be parents themselves. They were frequently absent even when they were present, hitting the drugs and the Daiquiris hard and trying to ‚Äúfind themselves‚Äù in endless affairs and self-actualization scams like EST and Scientology. They sucked. Don sucks right along with them. He‚Äôs typical. \n\n2. Don‚Äôs own parents were even worse than most parents of their generation. As half-assed a Dad as he is, he is a better parent than they are by a country mile. \n\n3. Don doesn‚Äôt really know how to be a father, and he actively hates himself, but he loves his children. That love is repeatedly a surprise to him, and one of the genius moves of the show is that we get to watch this man who doesn‚Äôt understand love get completely flattened by his own love for his kids (and theirs for him), over and over again. That love is the one thing in life he can‚Äôt outrun. It‚Äôs wonderful. \n\nI think a better question might be ‚Äúdoes Don know what a good father is?‚Äù, but I think he‚Äôd just use that question in a pitch.', 'I love this!', 'He WANTS to be a good father but has no clue how to do that.  He had no dad, per we, to base anything on.  He lives in a world of illusion (marketing).  He can‚Äôt be a dad because he can‚Äôt be authentic.

The affair began after they got back from Italy, which means it's more than a couple of months after the birth and is beginning at the same time Don begins an affair with Sally's teacher.

I‚Äôve seen numerous great responses that I somewhat agree with, but I wanted to add my two cents on something that jumps out to me every time I rewatch. This is concerning fathers‚Äô rights.\n\nWhile I have nothing in common with Don, I share joint custody of a precocious young daughter, who reminds me very much of Sally circa- season 5. It breaks my heart every time I watch Henry tell Don on the telephone that he can‚Äôt come to Gene‚Äôs birthday party. While I have had many similar experiences in my life, I still have MUCH more freedom and parenting time with my daughter. Back then a father was viewed merely as a provider. Maybe this helps to explain why he sometimes acted as such. In court this type of behavior is called ‚Äúparental alienation‚Äù and it is one of the most painful things I‚Äôve ever experienced. When stuff like this happens to me in my life, at the very least I can hire a lawyer. Back then men had no recourse. It gave me a real thrill to watch Don show up to the party anyways and play with his children. They obviously wanted more time with Don, and it wasn‚Äôt necessarily his fault that that wasn‚Äôt always possible. And was anybody else as outraged as I was that Henry was going to get custody of the kids when Betty died?', 'I was pissed about the party and I was pissed because I feel like Don COULD have been a good father if he had sole custody of the kids. I could see a sort of rebirth happening for him if he had sole custody', 'Thank you for saying what I was thinking! This whole series does a great job of showing how people can just be a ‚Äúvictim of the times‚Äù. Look at Joan, Ginsberg or Freddie‚Ä¶or really any of the characters. It makes you wonder what injustices are happening in our OWN time.', ""So nobody wants to talk about how Sally cut off her hair so she could look like Don's current lover and thus gain her dad's attention?"", 'When you put it into the context of the times, he was an *okay* father. Perhaps I haven‚Äôt heard enough first-hand accounts of how Boomers were raised, but my parents, aunts and uncles have given me a general idea of how the men of the Silent Generation parented their children:\n\nThey were RARELY physically affectionate with their kids.\n\nThey wanted their children briefly seen and never heard.\n\nThey did not change diapers or get up with babies at night.\n\nGoing to school conferences or other functions was mom‚Äôs job.\n\nIf dad was home, the television was his, and you better not disturb him.\n\n‚ÄúWait til your father gets home‚Äù was a guarantee you were getting the belt.\n\nForget ever having a meaningful conversation with your father. ‚ÄúTalk to your mother.‚Äù\n\nMy paternal grandfather in particular was also a drunk and would disappear for days at a time with other women, except he didn‚Äôt provide well for his 6 children.\n\nWhen my maternal grandfather threw my grandmother through the patio window and she finally left him, he rarely visited or helped support any of his 6 kids. This was common and the reason child support laws were enacted.\n\nWhen my grandma remarried he was thrilled because in his mind that meant his former position as his children‚Äôs father had been filled by another man.\n\nSo yes, looking through a modern lens, Don was a shit father. Absolutely, he inflicted plenty of trauma on his children. But when you look at the times, he didn‚Äôt do the *bare* minimum of financially providing, which was literally all that was expected of him. Most kids of the day were lucky to get a grunt or nod from their fathers, even if they WERE home. Don clearly cared about his children. He didn‚Äôt disappear from his children‚Äôs life after Betty threw him out, as many divorced men did, especially considering Henry also loved Betty‚Äôs children.\n\nObviously if we‚Äôre measuring by 2021 standards, he‚Äôs still trash. But we‚Äôre talking about 1963, when beating your wife and kids was still ‚Äúa family matter‚Äù. He tried, and when he was there, he was probably more involved than his peers.', 'Don is a bad person, period.', 'I\'d say Don was a fucked up, but ultimately good person. Most of the times we see him be ""a bad person"", it\'s an effect of him struggling with his obvious issues', 'My impression on Don is that he pretty much thinks all the parenting should be done by Betty, that being a parent was what SHE wanted and he is just the provider. \n\nGiven this, he does want to connect with his kids and tries from time to time, but these ""insightful"" moments can only do so much without the day-to-day toil.', ""Don is a terrible parent - as bad as, if not worse, than Betty.  Yes, men of that era generally did not show a lot of outward affection to their children, but they usually felt a great responsibility to their children.  This was often expressed through being the breadwinner and acting as the leader of the family with a duty to raise the children with a proper sense of right and wrong.  Even in that era, Don didn't hold up to the standards of the day.  Don really didn't care what happened at home and was annoyed when he had to get involved in anything. He would take off without a word whenever he wanted, leaving Betty to make up stories about where he was or when he was coming back.  He legitimately considered abandoning his kids more than once.  Even after the divorce, when he only had custody every other weekend, he'd leave them with a sitter if a better offer came along.  He missed most of the small day-to-day moments with the kids (his choice), only to try to compensate by making a big splash with Beatles tickets, a trip to Disney or a dog.  He was never a dependable.  Children need consistency and dependability.   \n\nNot trying to defend Betty because she did many indefensible things, but, as others have stated, at least she was there.  She was the one making sure they were fed, that they had clean clothes, and that they went to school and got their homework done.  Don treated the kids like toys to be put on a shelf when you are tired of playing with them, expecting them to still be there waiting when, and if, you decide to come back to them."", 'On first watch I was so anxious that something would come up and Don would flake on the Beatles tickets for Sally.

Certainly not something to write an essay about that has a simple answer', 'In comparison to the typical white suburban dad of the 50s/60s, and the typical view of masculinity at the time, yeah he‚Äôs a good father. Today he‚Äôs be considered a non entity.\n\nDon does actually love his kids, he‚Äôs even surprised that he does. The thing that hampers him from being a Great dad is the same thing that gets in the way of every relationship; Don doesn‚Äôt know what love *looks* like. He tries to show it, he tried to identify it, but he just can‚Äôt. His father and step mother didn‚Äôt demonstrate it to him or each other. His only real childhood basis is probably his relationship with Adam.\n\nHe reminds me of my grandpa, in that he was a good but not very demonstrative father, which motived my dad to be more caring and affectionate. Don tries but he‚Äôs probably just the example to his kids of what they should grow beyond.', ""Men in the 50's did not commonly abandon their children the way that Don often did. He was baseline decent for the time if you don't count all of the times that he was just gone, with no reason ever given."", 'Sure they did.

Can you imagine how embarrassed you'd be with a houseful of judgey neighbors seeing this go down?  I think it was Carlton who says something about leaving the party, and when told the cake hasn't been served yet, he laughs and says Don's not coming back.

But who knows how much of that time is actually spent with him and how much is spent with a babysitter/Megan. He‚Äôs enough of an absent parent that Sally told him not to bother coming home and she thought their step dad would be a better parent to her siblings. That had to hurt Don to hear, but I definitely don‚Äôt blame Sally for feeling that way.

I don‚Äôt know how to explain it well at the moment but the plot holes/inconsistencies/coincidences/whatever stood out more cause I wasn‚Äôt as ‚Äúin‚Äù the story since I knew where it was going.\n\nThat‚Äôs a horrible description of what I mean but it just didn‚Äôt feel as tightly plotted or smart on rewatch even though I still really enjoyed it. \n\nI‚Äôd have to have a fresher memory of it to really explain what I mean/give examples though.', 'I had a similar reaction on my most recent BB rewatch.  For some reason the show lost me in S3 with Walt‚Äôs transformation. In S2 he breaks down and cries when he sees Jane die. Then in S3 he suddenly runs over two drug dealers with his car and shoots one in the head. Seemed like a big leap especially considering those events are only a couple months apart. \n\nAlso, the passage of time being only a year from Pilot to early S5 is too little. I understand his life expectancy was short, but I found it hard to believe a person could change that drastically in a single year.', 'Sopranos and Mad Men are definitely my top two, in that order, but I would place The Wire and The Americans above The Leftovers in my Top 5.', 'Have you watched Six Feet Under?', 'I think most people would definitely agree with you that Season 5 of the Wire was the weakest.  Fantastic show but the serial killer plotline really derailed the last season', 'wow that‚Äôs awesome! i will definitely try it in that case.', 'I watched the first season of The Wire. It depressed the hell out of me.', 'Oh yeah. The whole series, while wonderful and full of great characters and, is also ... sad and hopeless ultimately.', 'Ironically I find Mad Men more depressing. The Wire is about good people in a bad situation. Mad Men is about bad people in a good situation. No matter how much money and success they are showered in they are eternally unhappy.

He sleeps with every breathing woman he comes across, he abandons his family and his duties whenever he can, etc. I don't think we should compare who's the worst person because it doesn't make sense but saying that Don is more relatable than Tony doesn't really make sense.\n\nTony feels just as human as Don because he isn't just your average mob boss. He has a real personality, real emotions that are contradictory most of the time, etc. The therapy sessions are there so you can understand his viewpoint."", ""Tony is in the waste management business.

Honestly Mad Men and Soprano‚Äôs are neck and neck for being my favorite series.', ""yes watch the sopranos!! My top 3 is Mad Men #1 followed by The Wire and the sopranos in a tie for second but an arms length behind Mad Men. I also recommend Boardwalk Empire as Terry Winter is also a team Sopranos grad like Weiner and did a great job on this show. Also if you're looking for a not too long of a series The Deuce on HBO Max is only 3 seasons about the fall of the pimp game and the rise of porn in manhattan in the decade of the 70's. Simon who did the Wire did this show and to me it was his best work since The Wire as I wasn't the biggest Treme fan."", 'Mad Men is my favorite drama ever. I watched The Sopranos during the first few months of the pandemic and I was not a fan. Tony has none of the charm of Don so I found it very very hard to watch a show focusing on him.

I never rooted for Tony because he was a straight killer and asshole.', ""Even some of Tony's most ardent haters can admit the man is one charming charasmatic character.

I absolutely loved Don, found him the perfect antihero who you scolded but still loved at the end of the day. Tony much is harder to love', ""100% agree.

Both shows explore depth of character in an interesting way.', 'Absolutely', ""I got HBOmax and watched the Sopranos all the way through for the first time recently.

It's an emotional roller coaster."", 'Yes you absolutely should. The depth of the drama is just as deep in the Sopranos. The script is incredible. And beyond that, it is arguably a more cinematic experience than Mad Men. \n\nAfter that, watch The Wire. Those are the top 3.', 'Yes, The Sopranos is the ONLY show as good as Mad Men. By the end of it, you may even feel it‚Äôs slightly better. \n\nThe first season is a bit more comedic than the rest, and is the only season I find that has really dated. It was revolutionary in 1999, but we‚Äôve seen a lot better since then.  But by the end of Season 2, you should be hooked. \n\nTo me, The Sopranos gets better with each season. The seasons that Weiner was a writer and producer on, 5 and 6, are incredible and you will notice many parallels to his writing on Mad Men. \n\nFor excellent analysis of each episode, check out sopranosautopsy.com\n\nDefinitely give it another chance.

You should definitely watch it. And I‚Äôm my opinion, it has much more of a rewatch quality than Mad Men', ""I tried. I could't get past he opening scene, which is extremely violent. I'm scared the show will have the mains be really random and unhinged about inflicting violence. Like crazy 8 in breaking bad.\n\nSomeone said Sopranos was good because it was the first of its kind, but now other things have built upon it and maybe eclipsed it ... so I figure, don't watch it if I don't enjoy it. I know this is unhelpful."", ""1st season of The Sopranos is trash. It's hard for me to even consider the 1st season under the same umbrella as the remainder of the series. I've literally told various persons to start on the 2nd season- because the quality &amp; style of storytelling takes such a jump- that is where I see the show truly beginning.\n\nThe whole 1st season feels very much like a rough pilot that I was not meant to see. They start pulling their punches and becoming more nuanced refrained storytellers in their 2nd year.\n\nI'm honestly surprised I don't see more people with this same opinion, but to my surprise I see a lot of people praising the 1st season- it boggles me.\n\nPS don't watch the movie.\n\nPPS- Irregardless! you may still not like it, don't force a square block, and MM still trumps all."", 'trash is a little harsh, no lol?

It‚Äôs not every episode all the time, it has brilliant character development and acting, really incredible writing esp. after season 3, and some of the more epic moments I‚Äôve seen on TV. \n\nBut the violence pops up pretty frequently and it‚Äôs filmed to feel as real and brutal as possible, kind of like deadwood or goodfellas. they also really f with your head by having horrible/shocking things happen to the most innocent characters, etc. \n\nI did like the show but some girlfriends I tried watching it with were horrified and now I remember the disturbing parts more or as much as the really cool &amp; interesting parts.', ""Yea, I just started watching it (I'm on season 4 now maybe?), and Mad Men is my favorite series of all time.

I don\'t see why Mad Men necessarily has a broader scope than the Sopranos.\n\nAlso, I love Mad Men, but the Sopranos is definitely the better show - especially when you factor in how ground breaking it was at the time and how many subsequent shows - including Mad Men - are deeply influenced by it and probably couldn\'t exist without it.', 'How?

,Alison‚Äôs Office Escapades,"Sorry if this has been addressed on here before, but after re-watching ‚ÄòChristmas Comes But Once A Year‚Äù for the umpteenth time, I have to ask this on here. 

It‚Äôs pretty heavily implied that Alison slept with Ken during the Nixon-Kennedy election party, and she is seen again sitting on his lap during the party where Guy loses a foot. She obviously understands how the office works and chooses to participate in the hanky-panky that goes on there.

That being said, even knowing what a horndog/trainwreck Don is, she still chooses to sleep with him anyway even though she knows he‚Äôs just drunk, and then acts surprised when he blows her off the next day. Don paying for her ‚Äúservices‚Äù with her bonus obviously didn‚Äôt help the situation either, but I honestly still find it strange how badly she reacts to everything when there was never any romantic chemistry between them and she knows what kind of man Don is. 

Am I missing something?",20,"['Great observation! I reckon that she saw Don as a mature, older head while Ken was just a bit of fun between two young professionals. She was surprised at how badly Don handled the situation - maybe she thought they‚Äôd start a relationship or regular hook-up - and as you say, him giving her cold hard cash made it worse.', '&gt; him giving her cold hard cash made it worse.\n\nTHAT‚ÄôS WHAT THE MONEY IS FOR!', ""Holy fuck just realized that the two may be directly related, I'll need to rewatch again. Obviously he tries to solve problems with money but I never made this connection!"", 'Also we should add that Ken is probably the best husband/one of the most sensitive guys in the office. He probably was a gentlemen/knew how to emotionally handle the one night stands better than Don, and maybe Alison was hoping that kind of treatment from Don', 'I think it\'s established in the show that secretaries know their bosses quite intimately (besides sexually) in that they know their daily habits, favorite drinks, their kids\' birthdays, what kind of mood they\'re in etc.\n\nThere\'s also a bit of a power dynamic. She may see it as the charming, handsome, rich, ""Don Draper"" choosing her, and she\'s seduced by that. Don\'s a person who seems mysterious and doesn\'t open up to people, so I\'m sure she assumes (incorrectly) that their tryst is an invitation for their relationship to go further \n\nI can easily see Alison getting feelings for Don after a hookup and not someone like Ken, who is more of a peer in age and someone she just casually interacts with at the office.', 'I agree with this as the reasoning and you can mainly see the expectation written all over her face when Alison interacts with him after they sleep together.', 'I don‚Äôt know that Don‚Äôs sexual exploits were really well known in the office. I don‚Äôt think we ever saw him get involved with a secretary until Alison. I think she had it in her head that they were going to run off into the sunset together.', 'Yeah, he says to Peggy and Joan that he didn‚Äôt sleep with secretaries as a rule. Remember how he iced out Jane? When he breaks this rule, it‚Äôs a sign that his alcoholism is progressing and his self control is collapsing. He treated Alison as disposable and took her for granted and she reacts to that because she‚Äôs not as jaded as a lot of the characters.', 'I remember in season 1 that Harry said ""no one\'s ever lifted that rock"" referring to Don\'s personal life.  An interesting thing about Don\'s personality to me is that he really doesn\'t want a reputation as a ""ladies man"" even though he has so many affairs.  I don\'t think he really likes that part of who he is (at least while he\'s married) but he frequently indulges it anyway.', 'I don\'t think Alison thought she and Don were necessarily going to become a thing, I thought she was mostly hurt by the fact that he didn\'t even mention it. She was expecting him to say something like, ""Look, about last night. I had a great time, but I\'m not looking for anything long-term. Is that okay?"" The fact that he *completely* didn\'t mention it meant in her eyes that it meant absolutely nothing, and by extension, that *she* meant absolutely nothing. If he had said anything about it, I don\'t think it would have impacted her the same way.', 'Sitting on kens lap at a party also seem like it doesn‚Äôt inherently mean they hooked up', 'Regarding the bonus, I thought that Don had set that aside before anything happened between the two them. She was an excellent secretary and assistant, certainly deserving of a bonus, but their hookup made it terribly awkward.', 'I know how it looks, but according the commentary track that bonus money really had nothing to do with ""paying her"" for the night before.  It was already in his desk before any of that happened.  Still, Alison didn\'t necessarily know that.', 'Thank you! I‚Äôve watched them hundreds of times on Netflix and now Amazon Prime Video but I‚Äôm\na sucker for a good commentary so I‚Äôll have to get the DVD‚Äôs as well. It was my understanding as well that the timing was just bad and not necessarily the reason he was paying her but ouch just the same.', ""Sure!  Yeah I shelled out like 90 bucks for the blu rays after Netflix dropped the show but I definitely think it was worth it.  Just so you know, season 6 on DVD doesn't have commentary tracks but the complete series on blu ray does, no idea why."", 'That‚Äôs what the money‚Äôs for!', 'Never met a woman before?', 'We get it, you haven‚Äôt.', 'Damn...', ""I think it's fucked how Alison reacts and Peggy is right to tell her to grow up tbh.""]"
,Do you think Henry and the kids kept in contact after?,"Whenever I watch the scene between Don and Betty and Betty explains that the kids will live with her brother, I always feel sad that the kids will basically lose two parents with Betty's death. I understand why Betty chose to have them live with their aunt and uncle, and how important it was especially in those times to have a nuclear family with a mom and a dad in the household. Henry seems like a stand-up guy who supported Betty's choice because she's their mom and their blood parent, but I think about if he gave her decision much fight. He's been there since before Gene was born and the better father, in comparison to Don. I always wonder if after Betty died, did he make trips to visit the kids (doesn't Betty's brother and SIL live a few hours away)? Did communication stay consistent? I guess we'll never really know but I hope it did.",21,"['I hope so too. I liked some of the little things, like when the kids wanted to eat dinner with him (he usually got home late) so he made it back earlier for a family dinner.

But as it stands, Henry would want the kids and vice versa, and no one's really going to oppose. It should also carry weight that the 15 year old child firmly believes they should stay where they are."", 'That‚Äôs a great point that I hadn‚Äôt thought of - William has his own kids to deal with and probably did not want 3 more. I highly doubt Betty made a will on her own, married women didn‚Äôt do things like that in those days.', 'Bill would have fought for them as there would be $$ attached.', 'I think with how Betty acted and how she was angry at her father for making preparations for his death she most likely tried to have that in writing.', 'I think you‚Äôre right about that.

,"Finished watching season 2 for the first time, here are my thoughts","Some of you might remember this post I made a while back about my first watch of season 1: https://www.reddit.com/r/madmen/comments/revegy/first_watch_finished_season_1_here_are_my/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

Well, as promised, I'm here now with my thoughts about season 2. I'm sorry it took so long, I don't like binge-watching. Will try to be faster next time

So, I've been watching through all the big, acclaimed TV shows in the last few years; Game of Thrones, The Sopranos, The Wire, Breaking Bad, and so on. What I've noticed is that season 2 is often the slowest season. It's the one where the show has to take the initial premise introduced in the first season, consolidate it, expand it, and give it the depth required as a foundation for the rest of the show.

And season 2 of Mad Men is no different. It took everything I liked from season 2 and gave it all the more focus. But it definitely took its time in doing so. In many ways it felt transitionary; taking stock of the previous season and preparing us for what's to come.

Where it did really well was, once again, the characters. They already showed a lot of promise in the first season, and here is where they really start to come alive and feel real.

Let's start with Don himself. When I first started watching, he felt like a man who, all things considered, was in charge of himself. He knew life, knew himself, he was in control.

The more I watch, the more that illusion begins to crumble. Is he really in charge of himself if he can give certain instructions for an ad design in one moment, and completely change his mind the next? Is he really in control if he compulsively jumps from one affair to the next, with little thought about the consequences, both external and internal?

Sure, he has mastered the art of deception, of creating, selling and maintaining a narrative on the spot. Living with a fake identity probably teaches you some of that. But any reminder of the truth can shake him and throw him off. The scene where Sally's words brings him to think of Bobbie when shaving one morning really brought this home. 

This becomes all the more evident in the last couple of episodes, when Betty throws him out of the house. The idea that the little world he has created with his family could fall apart genuinely terrifies him. Does he love Betty, does he care about being a good father, a family man? It's doubtful, but he definitely wants to maintain that self image. 

Speaking of Betty, she was probably the standout character of the season. Much like Don, she's eager to maintain the appearance of domestic bliss. But she can't do it by herself, and when she's confronted with the reality of his latest affair, she literally throws up. Sure, their marriage wasn't perfect, but she tried, for him. He couldn't try for her.

With the horses, the seperation, and even her own little affair in the finale, she's slowly forcing herself to take some agency in a life that didn't turn out like she expected. Giving up the illusions she's lived by is hard, but it's becoming the only way forward. With the impending loss of her father, and her disillusionement with Don, she's going to have to learn to live on her own accord.

As of the finale, it seems like their teased divorce might not come to be. Will Don make the effort to keep their marriage alive? I remain skeptical. Genuine change takes hard work and introspection. Falling back on old habits is always a lot easier.

Beyond the Drapers, Pete remains a favorite. Watching him jumping to and from different roles, always trying and always failing to prove himself, is quickly turning him into the underdog of the show. He's impatient, he's insecure, he's all over the place with his emotions, but goddamnit, I want to see him succeed in the end.

His marriage with Trudy continues to show just how little control he really has. Say what you want about his ""hell's bells"" tantrum, but it would be frustrating for anybody to have all your reservations about something like adoption be treated like a silly thing and frequently dismissed. 

I kept wondering if he would ever find out about his parentage to Peggy's son, and he finally did in the finale, in what was probably the most emotional scene of the show so far. Where will he go now?

And then there's Peggy. An essential character this season. From Father Gill, to Don, to Joan, to the European gay guy, impressions are made on her that will shape her for the future.

But best of all was her interactions with Bobbie. She instructed her to act like an equal, to make her place in the world, not as one of the guys, but as a woman. With her gaining her own office by the end of the season, Peggy is set to break out more and more as a character.

Roger is great, as usual, but I feel his role was reduced from season 1. Even something that should be significant, like him leaving his wife for Jane, is largely just happening in the background.

But Joan is growing as a character at the same time. Between her brief task with proof-reading scripts, and her engagement to an increasingly unpleasant guy, she's gaining complexity beyond being the resident queen bee of the office.

The guys claim that ""Marilyn is really a Joan"", and Marilyn turns out to be someone she cared about in a great scene after her suicide. ""This world destroyed her"" she says. Beyond all the apperances and power plays, it takes a toll on you to live like Joan does.

Harry turned out to be a great little side character with his TV department. 

Sal was given more flashes of depth with his closeted life.

Paul becomes unbearable with his attempts at being profound. Claiming he cancelled the California trip to attend the rally? He's full of shit.

And then there's Duck of course. A new important character of the season. With the impending merger and his waning patience with Don, he's shaping up to even more important. 

I said in my last post that the early 60s mostly feel like an extension of the 50s. This remains mostly true in season 2 as well, but here we really begin to see the last remnants of the 50s unravel, in keeping with the recurring them of shattered illusions. The missile crisis, the death of Marilyn, Peggy's haircut, the coffee-song the Smiths come up with (when thinking young), the signs of the decade that's about to unfold are becoming more and more frequent. 

We have all probably had this moment when first watching a show, when a scene comes to an end and we're left with a feeling of ""man, I'm really falling in love with this show, huh?""

For me, that was, for some reason, the end of ""The Inheritence"". Don and Pete on a flight to Los Angeles, Telstar playing in the background as the credits come in. The show has earned my devotion now. Time to sit back and watch it hit its stride.

If I have to name a favorite episode, I will probably go with the finale; ""Meditations in an Emergency"". With the backdrop of the missile crisis, everything in the season comes to its head, and it pays off really well.

Overall, I feel I liked seasons 1 and 2 roughly equally. Is this the end of the beginning? Is the best yet to come? I'm gonna have to find out.

I'll make a post when I finish season 3, if interest remains alive for it.",17,"['This is a wonderful breakdown of the season, with some great (and accurate) insights. \n\nIs this the first watch for you?

,"Don: ""Why is sex the definition of being close to someone?"" Betty: ‚ÄúI don't know. But it is for me, it is for most people.""","How do you interpret this dialogue? (Season 6, ep9)",9,"['Don spent his formative years around people who had sex without the feelings. He knows that it can be purely transactional and mechanical rather than needing to be emotional and intimate', 'I viewed this line as pretty healthy to be honest. Sometimes when a line like this sticks with me I like to ask ‚Äúwho is this character thinking about when they say this?‚Äù Don‚Äôs relationships with Peggy and Anna fit the bill for sure. They are both incredibly close to him and yet, he has not slept with either of them. Looking at this from a removed or detached view is certainly possible given his childhood or adult age promiscuity but there‚Äôs also a pretty vulnerable one.', 'Yes! He‚Äôs not just saying people have sex with no feelings, he‚Äôs saying that feeling close to someone can happen without sex. Even having titles like ‚Äúson‚Äù or ‚Äúfather‚Äù or ‚Äúhusband‚Äù don‚Äôt equate to closeness to Don. It‚Äôs something he‚Äôs always searching for.', 'Like the other comments said, Don‚Äôs childhood growing up in a brothel definitely influenced his feelings towards sex and he knows that it can be transactional. \n\nBut for Betty, I think her views towards sex were influenced by cultural and gender norms of the era she grew up in as well. Sex was a topic that wasn‚Äôt supposed to be discussed. Women were shamed if they slept around, the main idea being that the only person a woman should ever sleep with was her husband (someone she‚Äôs emotionally close to.) She hasn‚Äôt slept with many people in her entire life (probably as a result of both personal feelings and societal expectations) which is why she thinks of sex being intertwined with emotional intimacy.', 'Pretty wild that Betty only slept with 3 people in her entire life. Don, Cuban Missle Crisis hookup, and Henry', 'For most people, sexual intimacy is an important part of romantic relationships. Many people want to have a sexual connection with their romantic partner as an opportunity to bond and show affection and love. \n\nThis is how Betty views sex‚Äî she values it and understands it‚Äôs importance in a relationship. However, Don‚Äôs perception of sex is so warped from his childhood sexual abuse that he doesn‚Äôt value it at all anymore. Growing up in a brothel made it so Don views sex as currency or solely for physical pleasure. He feels nothing.', 'Don seems to value sex as a *service* he provides. Many times in the show we‚Äôre reminded he doesn‚Äôt just get laid a lot - he performs for the women to the point he has a reputation for his prowess. Betty even notices sometimes he seems to be doing what someone else likes in bed. Like a lot of abuse survivors, Don sees his sexual performance as a way of proving his worth.', 'I also think that for Don, because of his sexual trauma, he is most likely using sex as an escape and probably isn‚Äôt all the way present. I don‚Äôt doubt that he enjoys sex, but his dialogue here suggests that he doesn‚Äôt it see the physical connection of sex as intimacy. So I imagine sex is playing another role, seeking pleasure, but isn‚Äôt him being known. And he would prefer it that way.', ""Don's not as good at separating sex from emotions as he thinks he is.

,Interesting connection in season 6,"I don't know if I'm reaching or not but in 06x08 ""The Crash"", ""Grandma Ida"" probably broke into Don's apartment from the rear door that Don left open because he was taking the stairs to stalk around Sylvia's apartment. After the event, Don phones Sally and tells her: ""I left the door open, it was my fault.""

In 06x12 ""Favors"", Sally gets into Don's apartment from the rear door and catches Don sleeping with Sylvia. Throughout the season, there is a repetition of the motif of the door. For instance, the season opener is titled ""The Doorway"" and Dick watched people in the brothel having sex through a door peephole. 

The rear door in Don's apartment may represent his secret relationship with Sylvia or, more broadly, sins. At least three commandments are flouted when someone walked through that door: ""thou shalt not steal"" (Grandma Ida), ""thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife"" and ""thou shalt not commit adultery (Don).

Besides the symbolism, it's kind of ironic that Don apologises to Sally about the door left open and manages to get caught red-handed by her, four episodes later. Don never learns.",10,"['Going off of OP‚Äôs idea of Don and sins, I started to wonder about Don‚Äôs views of religion and sin. Abigail seemed to be the type to pass onto him that the world and its people are sinful‚Ä¶but Don seemingly never learned about other concepts like forgiveness, grace, doing good works, etc. So you end up with a man stunted because he thinks he will always sin so he doesn‚Äôt ever really try to stop himself.\n\nJust trying to build on an idea, not trying to teach anyone about religion or Jesus. ‚ÄúHe either lives in your heart or he doesn‚Äôt.‚Äù', 'I don‚Äôt think the doorway that Sally catches Don cheating through is the same door.

The same door Don would stand outside of chain smoking, the same door he leaned on during his manic episode during ‚ÄúThe Crash.‚Äù', 'Doorways seem to be a big important theme throughout the entire series, and especially Season 6. In the beginning of the season, Roger talks to his therapist about life just being a series of doorways ‚Ä¶ and hallways, and bridges, and more doorways.\n\nIn ‚ÄúFavors,‚Äù after the Sylvia incident, Don tries to calm Sally down *through her door* which helps to highlight the distance between them, a blockage in their relationship. After a certain point, he surrenders and goes in his room and shuts the door. We are left out in the hallway staring down the corridor at Don‚Äôs closed door, and this is the final shot of the episode. \n\nConversely, in S4E7 ‚ÄúThe Suitcase,‚Äù the final scene of the episode is Peggy asking Don if he wants his door open or closed. Don responds, ‚ÄúOpen.‚Äù This highlights the idea that he was able to be more honest because Peggy broke through to him. He is clearly capable of being open and vulnerable to people, it‚Äôs just very rare and not what he is used to.\n\nIs life just a series of doorways and hallways and bridges? There is something bleak about this viewpoint, but also something tragically beautiful. We have the existential vastness and meaninglessness on the one hand. On the other hand, if life is indeed a series of doorways and hallways, then in order to connect with someone, all we have to do is walk down the hallway and open a door.

,Were the casting directors deliberately trying to make sure that no male cast member was as handsome as Jon Hamm?,"Every other male cast member besides Don looks like a regular dude. Even the ones that are good looking like Pete Campbell and Roger Sterling, they are regular people good looking. They're the kind of good looking I expect to see every day walking down the street. Don on the other hand is like a fantasy man. No one else on the show looks like him or carries themselves the way he does. He's a special kind of handsome that makes him stand out even in a group of very handsome men ala the rest of the mad men cast. So I wonder if the casting director was deliberately making sure that no one else on set could steal the spotlight from Don. It would make sense given that that's his character. He's supposed to represent the male wish fulfilment fantasy. The kind of man every guy wants to be and every girl wants to be with. 

The only other man on the show I can think of that comes close to Don was Guy Mackendrick in season 3 who also looks way more handsome than the men around him (although I'm partial to Jon Hamm) and also carries himself with the same kind of suave confident demeanor as Don. His character is actually set up to be Don's competition (until his foot gets massacred by the John Deere) and someone (I think it was Cooper) who even comments how Guy is replacing Don and Don's novelty is being threatened by Guy's presence.",136,"['Not sure where you live that you see guys who look like John Slattery walking down the street every day, but he is a very good looking man.

He spent years of his life fighting Germans, being tortured or mistreated by them, and seeing friends or innocent people die at the hands of them. \nAfter years of being held prisoner, fighting them, and even helping people escape them from the horrors of the camps he refused to ever use german made products on his farms when he got home.\n\nHe didn't like having German products on his property in New zealand and would basically rather burn a free Volkswagen than let it on his property.\n\nNow if you're put in a time where prejudice of many kinds exists against all people then you understand one thing.

Oh hell yes.\n\nCould I ask you (or anyone) to forget how you got that level of hate?\n\n No it would be like saying forget those years of war and those people you saw die infront of you, to them.\n\nIn the end it's a product of the times and as much as it is terrible, it comes from a place that you can hardly forget, nor want to put past yourself.

,"""There are six phone numbers for Herman Phillips...""","Megan mentions  this when she's planning the surprise party for Don, and she asks Peggy if he's important. Peggy says ""That's Duck,"" and crosses his name off the guest list. 

Anyone wonder *why* Don had so many numbers for Duck? I thought at first maybe it was an old listing in his Rolodex from when Duck was still working with them. But he wouldn't have had so many different numbers - even if he moved apartments (and, no cell phones back then, of course) 

So I guess some of these are phone numbers for other agencies Duck worked with after he left Sterling Cooper.  Was Don just wanting to keep track of what Duck was up to? If so, I find that kind of surprising. Don never acted as if he was that interested in Duck's movements - or acted as if he considered Duck a threat.

,Joan And Jaguar: Cornered victim or savvy entrepreneur?,"Let's get the obvious out of the way first.

Herb is a disgusting pig of a man. His actions were unethical and sadly is probably not an anomaly in the real world.

However in mad men posts this situation gets brought up as Joan being a victim.

I am a bit surprised this is the view that's taken. Joan from the very start has always been shown to be a smart, savvy, and very cunning woman. Yes her position as lead secretary is a result of the times and less a reflection of the best use of her talents. I don't think she ever felt compelled to do it. She certainly was quick to blast Pete for the mere suggestion.

Instead once Lane offered the parternship, I think she saw it for the opportunity that it was. 

Ultimately while this was a shady business transaction, there was never a threat of job loss or loss of livelihood coming if she said no. Certainly Roger would never let that happen.",9,"['Joan knows the game and plays it very well but it‚Äôs unfortunate that she has to play it to get ahead.  She doesn‚Äôt have the creative ability or even luck to be a Peggy (imagine if Peggy had never gotten overheard by Freddie).  She barely becomes an account manager in the later seasons.  It‚Äôs humiliating to even be offered a promotion for sex', ""Yes and I agree, that's a sad reflection of those times.   I will say, I never viewed Joan as a ruthless entrepreneur doing everything to get ahead. She certainly never went the route of Bob Benson.\n\nRemember her relationship with Roger Sterling pre-dates Don's arrival. If she wanted to be a future Mrs Sterling, she could have engineered that. But that wasn't her goal. I think her dream was always to marry a non rapist version of Greg Harris and retire and be normal. That's why I think if he wasn't out of the picture and she wasn't effectively a single mother raising a child, she probably turns the offer down.\n\nThat makes her more of a pragmatist than a victim imo."", 'I think when you feel like you have no choice (even if they pretend and say she can back out any time) it‚Äôs not really a true consensual choice', ""I think it's a little bit of both. She's a very capable office manager and secretary who would have been qualified for a partnership role. I think her disappointment stemmed from how even in spite of all of this the only way she can truly get ahead and in a more powerful position is if she relies on her body/sexuality. I think she was reluctant to do it, especially given that she is a victim of sexual assault, and was waiting for a man to tell her it would be a crazy thing to do. That was why it was so upsetting that Don didn't get to her in time to stop her.  At least that's how I saw it."", 'I agree with a bit of both. She used her savvy to get the best possible outcome from a lose/lose situation that the other partners cornered her in to.', 'As we know, the partners at Sterling Cooper (or whatever agency it was at the time) have long memories and short tempers. Joan knew if she said no to Herb, she\'d never hear the end of it. The partners in favor of it would grumble about it and take jabs at her for YEARS to come. They\'d never really ""forgive her"" for it.', 'Yeah, remember what Roger says in season 7?\n\n‚ÄúI once held Lee Jr‚Äôs balls in my hand‚Äù', 'She used the tools she had and did very well out of it. \n\nMany other people have todo the same but don‚Äôt end up millionaires. \n\nIt‚Äôs up to Joan to decide if she was a victim or not not really for us to say', 'Jaded but savvy Entrepreneur. I think finally she‚Äôd had it with trying to win the agency‚Äôs respect even though she deserved it. I saw it as her saying she could beat the bros at their own game once she gets power as a partner. Joan isn‚Äôt sad, she‚Äôs PISSED.\n\nAnd let‚Äôs be real, glorifying a product you know leads people to a horrible death is worse prostitution than having sex with a gross chump.

But these are *very* arbitrary lines around which to define who gets to participate in conversation. I would argue you\'ve excluded something like 40% of people with ""outmoded"" alone, because them not fully being up to speed on the latest manner with which to converse with others is disqualifying for *even participating in the conversation.* That\'s not to mention how easy it is to just speculate on a person\'s motivations and disqualify them based on that. \n\nAnd you know what happens when you do that? You have a huge number of people not participating in your conversation, and angry at not being allowed in the conversation. And in your conversation, you have a bunch of people who all seem to agree on the same basic points, for example the idea that Hillary Clinton should be President. But 47 million people who happened to live in the right states found their way to be heard. \n\nWhat I\'m saying is that excluding people from dialogue on anything but the most stringent of standards has *dire consequences.*', '[deleted]', 'Ok zoomer', 'I find the fact that you are being downvoted very annoying.

But as he\'s sitting there facing *away* from the water in a place which is not Hawaii (his self-defined ""paradise""), Don starts to smile as he realizes that since all advertising is is telling you that you are okay, so too is spirituality. Think about what he said to Stephanie earlier in the episode, about how she wasn\'t raised with Jesus, so she didn\'t know how people can be when they believe in something. Buddhist ideas are, to Don, not really any different than Christian ideas but the culture of the \'70s opened the U.S. up to more Eastern spirituality going more mainstream.

It's not a mistake that Peggy and Don are the main characters who stay at McCann-- they both seek approval from others of their talent and genius. Contrast that with Joan, for instance. Sure, Joan likes to be admired and respected but she doesn't need anyone's approval for her actions. That's why she winds up in the finale being the one to have the most freedom and control over her life-- because, in the end, she's way more of an individual than even Don &amp; Peggy."", 'True, but I think that also partially accepting what was ""enough"" to be happy was part of each character\'s ending.

If don goes back to NY he will be an ad man, thus coke. \n"", ""I think the reason he has been fighting the large corporation for so many years because he doesn't want to feel invisible.

People do miss him."", ""That's how I originally saw it. After reading all this stuff I don't know.

Now, a show will be ordered by the season based on who's involved. Back when Mad Men was being greenlit, we were in a very dated process where Matt Weiner and co had exactly forty nine minutes to convince a room of people with money that this was worth 13 episodes and a budget. The pilot has to introduce all the important characters and show the beginnings of their arc: why we care about them, and the possibility of where they might end up.\n\nFor all the meandering and open-ended questions that are the Mad Men Hallmark, there is no room for idling in the pilot.\n\nThat said, I think S1 E1 is probably the best pilot I have EVER seen."", 'As much as LOST went completely off the rails in the later seasons, I‚Äôve never been as gripped by a series opener as I was with that show.

The production value and visuals are cheaper, the actors are different looking (Joan and Roger especially in MM), and the entire tone is just different....everything is just sloppier and less honed than they become later in the season, even starting with S01E02. Mad Men is a very good example of this, as is a lot of the great shows like Breaking Bad and Sopranos, as you mentioned (those exact shows are actually all on my top 3).

He pushed her away, time and time again until it sticked.\n\nDon ruined Betty and Don ruined Megan. He would've ruined Faye, too."", ""I agree with your conclusion but not what you said preceding it. Faye was exactly what Don needed. She is someone who challenged him and made him face his issues and his past and that's what he needed to do all along to grow. Instead he saw how good Megan was with his kids, and was again attracted to the idea of the perfect domestic figure who listens to him and doesn't challenge him. The kind of wife you'd see on TV or maybe manufacture as ideal for happiness if your job was advertising. Megan was what he wanted (the young lady who's a sweet wife and a good mother) not what he needed (the person who would help him face his demons and grow). \n\n At the end of the day Don is always attracted to the idea of people and things more than anything, that's why he's always drawn to strangers (both romantic and platonic) and he's just a broken man who struggles to form lasting human connection, even with the people he truly loves (like Betty) . His brief period with Linda Cardelinni's character where he wanted her to do nothing in a hotel room without him is exactly what he expects in a romantic relationship. He wants his partner to be an extension of him who's life only exists for him and his interests. \n\nSo while you're right that he can't be satisfied with one woman because he has weird sex issues from growing up in a brothel and having a very non-consensual first time, it's not as simple as that. He did genuinely try to be a good husband for Megan but the more she deviated from the idea of what he wanted her to be, the more he fell into his old patterns. It went gradually from her being 'shameless' when she performed zou bisou bisou, to her not liking the exact same sherbet that he did, to when she wanted to pursue a career that wasn't advertising, to the killing blow of her wanting to be an actress. What you said about her being a claming presence is also reflective of that cause she seems like that from the outside but when they actually got serious, it was clear that she's a fierce independent person who really isn't very calming.

The first season is a lot closer to a traditional gangster story.  It has a lot more cliches/some weird plot holes (Tony is boss in the pilot but a capo in the second episode).  The second season is where the show really comes into its own - becoming more of an American family chronicle than just a mob show.  (And it really is so much more - the show explores everything from mental health and depression to gender relations and family dynamics to Freud, the Oedipus Complex, and the long term decline of the United States).  Also, some of the most fantastic writing/acting is towards the end of the show (especially season 6).\n\nThat said, the Sopranos is an acquired taste.

Also if you're looking for a not too long of a series The Deuce on HBO Max is only 3 seasons about the fall of the pimp game and the rise of porn in manhattan in the decade of the 70's.

He knows that it can be purely transactional and mechanical rather than needing to be emotional and intimate', 'I viewed this line as pretty healthy to be honest. Sometimes when a line like this sticks with me I like to ask ‚Äúwho is this character thinking about when they say this?‚Äù Don‚Äôs relationships with Peggy and Anna fit the bill for sure. They are both incredibly close to him and yet, he has not slept with either of them. Looking at this from a removed or detached view is certainly possible given his childhood or adult age promiscuity but there‚Äôs also a pretty vulnerable one.', 'Yes! He‚Äôs not just saying people have sex with no feelings, he‚Äôs saying that feeling close to someone can happen without sex. Even having titles like ‚Äúson‚Äù or ‚Äúfather‚Äù or ‚Äúhusband‚Äù don‚Äôt equate to closeness to Don. It‚Äôs something he‚Äôs always searching for.', 'Like the other comments said, Don‚Äôs childhood growing up in a brothel definitely influenced his feelings towards sex and he knows that it can be transactional. \n\nBut for Betty, I think her views towards sex were influenced by cultural and gender norms of the era she grew up in as well. Sex was a topic that wasn‚Äôt supposed to be discussed. Women were shamed if they slept around, the main idea being that the only person a woman should ever sleep with was her husband (someone she‚Äôs emotionally close to.) She hasn‚Äôt slept with many people in her entire life (probably as a result of both personal feelings and societal expectations) which is why she thinks of sex being intertwined with emotional intimacy.', 'Pretty wild that Betty only slept with 3 people in her entire life. Don, Cuban Missle Crisis hookup, and Henry', 'For most people, sexual intimacy is an important part of romantic relationships. Many people want to have a sexual connection with their romantic partner as an opportunity to bond and show affection and love. \n\nThis is how Betty views sex‚Äî she values it and understands it‚Äôs importance in a relationship. However, Don‚Äôs perception of sex is so warped from his childhood sexual abuse that he doesn‚Äôt value it at all anymore. Growing up in a brothel made it so Don views sex as currency or solely for physical pleasure. He feels nothing.', 'Don seems to value sex as a *service* he provides. Many times in the show we‚Äôre reminded he doesn‚Äôt just get laid a lot - he performs for the women to the point he has a reputation for his prowess. Betty even notices sometimes he seems to be doing what someone else likes in bed. Like a lot of abuse survivors, Don sees his sexual performance as a way of proving his worth.', 'I also think that for Don, because of his sexual trauma, he is most likely using sex as an escape and probably isn‚Äôt all the way present. I don‚Äôt doubt that he enjoys sex, but his dialogue here suggests that he doesn‚Äôt it see the physical connection of sex as intimacy. So I imagine sex is playing another role, seeking pleasure, but isn‚Äôt him being known. And he would prefer it that way.', ""Don's not as good at separating sex from emotions as he thinks he is.

rscaqk,"Finished watching season 2 for the first time, here are my thoughts","Some of you might remember this post I made a while back about my first watch of season 1: https://www.reddit.com/r/madmen/comments/revegy/first_watch_finished_season_1_here_are_my/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

Well, as promised, I'm here now with my thoughts about season 2. I'm sorry it took so long, I don't like binge-watching. Will try to be faster next time

So, I've been watching through all the big, acclaimed TV shows in the last few years; Game of Thrones, The Sopranos, The Wire, Breaking Bad, and so on. What I've noticed is that season 2 is often the slowest season. It's the one where the show has to take the initial premise introduced in the first season, consolidate it, expand it, and give it the depth required as a foundation for the rest of the show.

And season 2 of Mad Men is no different. It took everything I liked from season 2 and gave it all the more focus. But it definitely took its time in doing so. In many ways it felt transitionary; taking stock of the previous season and preparing us for what's to come.

Where it did really well was, once again, the characters. They already showed a lot of promise in the first season, and here is where they really start to come alive and feel real.

Let's start with Don himself. When I first started watching, he felt like a man who, all things considered, was in charge of himself. He knew life, knew himself, he was in control.

The more I watch, the more that illusion begins to crumble. Is he really in charge of himself if he can give certain instructions for an ad design in one moment, and completely change his mind the next? Is he really in control if he compulsively jumps from one affair to the next, with little thought about the consequences, both external and internal?

Sure, he has mastered the art of deception, of creating, selling and maintaining a narrative on the spot. Living with a fake identity probably teaches you some of that. But any reminder of the truth can shake him and throw him off. The scene where Sally's words brings him to think of Bobbie when shaving one morning really brought this home. 

This becomes all the more evident in the last couple of episodes, when Betty throws him out of the house. The idea that the little world he has created with his family could fall apart genuinely terrifies him. Does he love Betty, does he care about being a good father, a family man? It's doubtful, but he definitely wants to maintain that self image. 

Speaking of Betty, she was probably the standout character of the season. Much like Don, she's eager to maintain the appearance of domestic bliss. But she can't do it by herself, and when she's confronted with the reality of his latest affair, she literally throws up. Sure, their marriage wasn't perfect, but she tried, for him. He couldn't try for her.

With the horses, the seperation, and even her own little affair in the finale, she's slowly forcing herself to take some agency in a life that didn't turn out like she expected. Giving up the illusions she's lived by is hard, but it's becoming the only way forward. With the impending loss of her father, and her disillusionement with Don, she's going to have to learn to live on her own accord.

As of the finale, it seems like their teased divorce might not come to be. Will Don make the effort to keep their marriage alive? I remain skeptical. Genuine change takes hard work and introspection. Falling back on old habits is always a lot easier.

Beyond the Drapers, Pete remains a favorite. Watching him jumping to and from different roles, always trying and always failing to prove himself, is quickly turning him into the underdog of the show. He's impatient, he's insecure, he's all over the place with his emotions, but goddamnit, I want to see him succeed in the end.

His marriage with Trudy continues to show just how little control he really has. Say what you want about his ""hell's bells"" tantrum, but it would be frustrating for anybody to have all your reservations about something like adoption be treated like a silly thing and frequently dismissed. 

I kept wondering if he would ever find out about his parentage to Peggy's son, and he finally did in the finale, in what was probably the most emotional scene of the show so far. Where will he go now?

And then there's Peggy. An essential character this season. From Father Gill, to Don, to Joan, to the European gay guy, impressions are made on her that will shape her for the future.

But best of all was her interactions with Bobbie. She instructed her to act like an equal, to make her place in the world, not as one of the guys, but as a woman. With her gaining her own office by the end of the season, Peggy is set to break out more and more as a character.

Roger is great, as usual, but I feel his role was reduced from season 1. Even something that should be significant, like him leaving his wife for Jane, is largely just happening in the background.

But Joan is growing as a character at the same time. Between her brief task with proof-reading scripts, and her engagement to an increasingly unpleasant guy, she's gaining complexity beyond being the resident queen bee of the office.

The guys claim that ""Marilyn is really a Joan"", and Marilyn turns out to be someone she cared about in a great scene after her suicide. ""This world destroyed her"" she says. Beyond all the apperances and power plays, it takes a toll on you to live like Joan does.

Harry turned out to be a great little side character with his TV department. 

Sal was given more flashes of depth with his closeted life.

Paul becomes unbearable with his attempts at being profound. Claiming he cancelled the California trip to attend the rally? He's full of shit.

And then there's Duck of course. A new important character of the season. With the impending merger and his waning patience with Don, he's shaping up to even more important. 

I said in my last post that the early 60s mostly feel like an extension of the 50s. This remains mostly true in season 2 as well, but here we really begin to see the last remnants of the 50s unravel, in keeping with the recurring them of shattered illusions. The missile crisis, the death of Marilyn, Peggy's haircut, the coffee-song the Smiths come up with (when thinking young), the signs of the decade that's about to unfold are becoming more and more frequent. 

We have all probably had this moment when first watching a show, when a scene comes to an end and we're left with a feeling of ""man, I'm really falling in love with this show, huh?""

For me, that was, for some reason, the end of ""The Inheritence"". Don and Pete on a flight to Los Angeles, Telstar playing in the background as the credits come in. The show has earned my devotion now. Time to sit back and watch it hit its stride.

If I have to name a favorite episode, I will probably go with the finale; ""Meditations in an Emergency"". With the backdrop of the missile crisis, everything in the season comes to its head, and it pays off really well.

Overall, I feel I liked seasons 1 and 2 roughly equally. Is this the end of the beginning? Is the best yet to come? I'm gonna have to find out.

I'll make a post when I finish season 3, if interest remains alive for it.",17,"['This is a wonderful breakdown of the season, with some great (and accurate) insights. \n\nIs this the first watch for you?

Without spoiling anything for you, I will say that the show does a fantastic job of showing how people and things change(or don‚Äôt) with the passage of time.

Trudy, on the other hand, had no such issues: she lived her life completely in sync with her childhood elitist teachings - because she believed them to be true. \n\nHer loyalty to Pete, his career, his needs - also reflects an attitude where she truly believed in gender roles of society.  \n\nTowards the end of my second watching, I had developed a high respect for Pete and kind of started disliking Trudy a lot. Put another way, she‚Äôs the only major character on the show whom I would expect to be unabashedly racist in real life.\n\nPS: Please be respectful in your comments. I can see my opinion is unpopular on this thread.', 'Ooh this is really interesting! For me she was in a really similar situation to Betty and handled it a lot better. Disappointed by the promises of marriage she grew up on. Trudy collected herself and made her life what she wanted and Betty took her problems out on everyone instead. Trudy put her kid first, which I respected a lot and feel like a lot of women at the time (and today even) wouldn‚Äôt do.\n\nI‚Äôm super surprised by her seeming one of the most racist to you. I felt like Pete is one of the less prejudiced characters on the show by the end, and from their post-assassination talks they seemed to be in a similar page on social issues. I might totally be missing something though. This is also not to say that she wasn‚Äôt 100% classist and racist - really every white person on the show was.', 'Yes to your comparison between Betty &amp; Trudy. I agree that Betty was way less of an adult that Trudy was (vis-a-vis her kid for example), even though they both had internalised their upbringing to a certain extent. \n\nBut only Betty (maybe because of her raging immaturity) is shown to question the status quo - like her beginning a career against her mother‚Äôs wishes, and struggling to get back to modelling afterwards, seeing a shrink against her husband‚Äôs wishes, shooting those birds, going to the city to rescue that violin girl, etc - she had courage and enough grit to do that. \n\nTrudy would not only not do any of those things (or do them differently), I feel she would judge the crap out of Betty for doing all that. \n\nAs for post-assassination episode (just actually had to watch the clip from that episode) - I mean that talk is very short to say anything about Trudy. \n\nI guess I‚Äôm just being overtly liberal with filling out the blanks, because Trudy is a truly supporting character on the show - we don‚Äôt see her outside of Pete‚Äôs shadow, so the show never spends any time in rounding out her character. She exists, only to be ‚Äòthe other side of Pete‚Äô.', 'Yeah I think we just have super different reads which is completely fair. Based on what little we see of Trudy, I totally could see her doing any of those things Betty did, and with better motivations too haha. We are both having to draw conclusions with very little info though. Anyway, thank you for the conversation! Was getting tired of ‚ÄúTrudy is hot‚Äù lol', 'I think Betty only ever did all those things because of her need for external validation. Trudy was confident and never seemed to put herself down or let anyone else put her down; the only thing she really struggled with emotionally was trying to get pregnant (and of course Pete cheating, but again she showed maturity in how she handled that).', 'Kind of disagree. Yes, Betty functioned purely on external validation - but many of the things like going to look for the violin girl or going to see a psychiatrist or studying psychology herself - were none of the things she did to impress anyone. Although sure, her modelling obsession obviously shows her need for validation. \n\nComing back to Trudy, in the episode where she finally tells Pete to leave (after he messes up with their neighbour) - she makes it very clear that she was aware of his sleeping around, that‚Äôs why she agreed to let him get an apartment in the city, so she could save face in society. In fact, the only reason she didn‚Äôt give Pete a divorce was because she didn‚Äôt want that label and society judging her that way. \n\nMeanwhile Betty was very oblivious to Don‚Äôs cheating, until she found out hard evidence. And she had the balls to get a divorce - in those moments she didn‚Äôt care about society‚Äôs validation.\n\nNot to mention their marriages. Trudy would never have married someone like Don as a young man.', 'I sort of disagree. Something I always got from the violin girl story was that Betty thought the girl would be ingratiated to her and be a kind of replacement daughter, as in receive some validation about being a good mom that she didn‚Äôt really get from Sally. She was far nicer to that girl than she would have been to Sally if she‚Äôd failed at something. \n\nAlso, Betty wasn‚Äôt ballsy enough to simply get a divorce. She slept with that random guy at the bar when she first found out she was pregnant with Gene, for a number of reasons: 1) to mentally and physically confirm that she was done with Don, 2) that other men still found her that attractive - which she already knows but needs constant reminders of, and 3) weird sense of doom about the Cuban missile crisis or whatever they were worried about in that episode. She also lined up Henry to marry immediately after. Trudy may not have gotten a divorce but she didn‚Äôt sleep with other men to validate her decision and openly kicked Pete out and kept up no pretenses about why. \n\nTrudy appeared to have always thought carefully and clearly about what she was doing and why, with Betty it was really never so.', 'I think we‚Äôre getting off-point here. My purpose of comparing Trudy with Betty was not to pit them against each other, but to establish a reference point for Trudy as she shares a very similar background to Betty. And despite her many, many flaws, Betty always challenged the status quo when she didn‚Äôt agree with it, but Trudy never did. \n\nAlso, I admit it is kind of unfair to compare the two as we know so much more about Betty than Trudy. \n\nHaving said that, I don‚Äôt see how internalising your husband‚Äôs philandering ([please see this](https://youtu.be/vTkSFUR9_BM)) for the very sake of keeping up pretences because - divorce is a ‚Äúfailure‚Äù - is a respectful decision. Let‚Äôs not forget, Trudy already knew about Pete cheating on her way before Tammy was even born - so she was clearly okay with denial over divorce. Not very mature in my books. \n\nYour line of thinking may obviously be different than mine, but that is just a calculative move to stay in uptight high-snobbery bubble - one I don‚Äôt respect.', 'If we are going to talk about calculated moves, lining up another husband before getting rid of the first is shady as hell too. That definitely kept Betty in the socioeconomic status she was accustomed to. But that‚Äôs besides the point. \n\nDon‚Äôt get me wrong, I love them both. Trudy is very much a foil to Betty imo. I just think she is able to process and handle things better and does a better job of straddling the line between regressive and progressive. She does seem to be the perfect housewife, but a ‚Äútraditional‚Äù woman would not approach her issues from the perspective that Trudy did. I think a large part of this is because she actually seems to have a good relationship with both her parents and none of the childhood trauma that Betty does. \n\nNeither is wrong in how they approach their life overall; it was a difficult time for women in general. They couldn‚Äôt exactly strike out on their own even if they wanted to, so they all kept up pretenses at least some of the time, but each did it at different times for different reasons.', 'She‚Äôs transparent in the best way. That‚Äôs her, all her. Genuine and good', 'To add to what others have said, I think she has the best morals of any character in the show. \n\nI can‚Äôt name a thing that she does wrong, when she would have been justified in taking the low road.', ""She perfectly balances great tenacity for being a woman in the 60s but also takes care of her man. She's a queen."", ""She's amazing in everything, including Princess Unikitty of Cloud Cuckoo Land!"", 'I think it‚Äôs because Alison Brie is hot as hell and palpably gives off Fuck me vibes', 'It‚Äôs Allison Brie dude. Hard not to love any of her characters. But on the real Trudy is such a sweet, loving wife. She‚Äôs patient and does so much for Pete, who‚Äôs pretty much a piece of shit through and through. She‚Äôs a 10/10', 'She‚Äôs attractive, loyal and at the same time, not afraid to put you in your place! Any man, person, who says they don‚Äôt admire that last quality is **lying**', 'i have always found it odd that people (mostly men in my experience but idk) are so obsessed with her, and the fact that many commenters are citing her ‚Äúloyalty‚Äù slightly rubs me the wrong way. I don‚Äôt think she has enough character development to warrant the obsession and she spent most of the series being a doormat  ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø', 'Thank you! Absolutely. I felt she was the least modern character in the show. Although she was truly a picture of how you‚Äôd expect a suburban housewife in the 60s to be like.', 'She‚Äôs very, very attractive. No need to overthink this.', 'Lol all the women in this show are stunning, and I do not like their characters as much. She is beautiful, though, yes.', 'Sure, but Betty gives you a lot of reasons to be ambivalent (at best) about her. Joan is pretty damn likable, but we learn enough about her to also find her pretty complex, and a source of some concern. Trudy is on screen just often enough that we see Allison Brie‚Äôs considerable charm, but it never gives her enough of a plot line that we learn a lot of her deeper traits. \n\nAnd she must have other, darker personal traits to cope with being married to Pete for the entirety of the show. She seems smart enough to know who he is, and isn‚Äôt delusional. But the show never really goes down that road (am I mistaken? Maybe It did and I don‚Äôt recall.) Thus you are left with charming attractive person whose inner depth is hinted at but never actually explored.', 'This is the comment I was looking for. You‚Äôre a good overthinker haha. I think what was left out definitely made her more intriguing to me, and made the moments where we learned more (like the insane charleston scene) so rewarding. I like the show to a fault so it‚Äôs hard for me to think it‚Äôs flat writing rather than intentional.', 'Yeah, I wouldn‚Äôt call it flat writing. It‚Äôs just tough to give every single side character their own arc. You can try, but you risk pulling a Sopranos and spending 1.5 entire episodes with Vito and JohnnyCakes.', 'You‚Äôre absolutely right.', 'Bc Alison Brie is extremely attractive', 'Hot', 'She‚Äôs incredibly selfless and kind, loyal, funny, witty, and gorgeous.

I love Alison Brie in community and other things but I don‚Äôt think she fit the era in this role', 'She\'s a feminine woman yet still strong and powerful. She doesn\'t become bitter even though she totally has the ""right"" too, and stays loyal despite the risk. She understands life is hard and people aren\'t perfect. In a world today where women think he answer to life is to be more like men Trudy is a woman through and through and still has as much character and strength as any other character on the show. \n\nThe scene where they find out Pete has no problems with his sperm and then Trudy starts getting mad and then Pete says ""what do you want me to say? This had to be a possiblity right?,"" and then she says, ""Yes you are right. I""m just upset that\'s all and I really want a child."" I was blown away.

rrua3v,What do you read into this iconic scene?,"The most obvious symbolism to me is Betty looking at herself in the mirror, pushing her boobs up, always very concerned with the way she looks.
Peggy wearing pantyhose instead of stockings, showcasing her ""modern working woman way"". She cares more about being comfortable and practical than sexy. If I read into it a tad too literally, she's putting another barrier between her sexual parts and the world.
But on Joan I can't even think of anything remarkable about the way she dresses, which is kind of surprising to me, because JOAN IN HER UNDERWEAR should be a huge deal (I don't mean it in the creepy way that Christina is hot, which of course she is, but in that Joan's character is very defined by her sexuality)

CAN YOU BELIEVE he was mad that AMC played ""You Know I\'m No Good"" in the promotions for Mad Men?
